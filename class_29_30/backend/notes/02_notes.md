Let's focus specifically on the `declare global` part and its role in the code.

---

### **What Does `declare global` Do?**
The `declare global` block is used to **extend or modify existing global type definitions** in TypeScript. In this case, it is extending the `Express` namespace to add a custom property, `userId`, to the `Request` interface.

#### Key Points:
1. **`declare global` is necessary to modify global types.**
   - Without `declare global`, TypeScript treats your type definitions as local to the file and doesn’t apply them globally to the `Request` type in your project.
   - `declare global` tells TypeScript: "This modification applies to the global type definitions, not just this file."

2. **Why the `namespace Express`?**
   - The `Express` namespace is where the `Request` type is originally defined (from the `@types/express` package). By reopening the namespace, you can add or modify properties in its interfaces (like `Request`).

---

### **Why Did We Write This?**
We wrote this to **add a custom property (`userId`)** to the `Request` object because Express's default `Request` type doesn’t include it. 

Without this declaration, the following line would cause a TypeScript error:

```typescript
req.userId = decoded.userTokenId; // TypeScript doesn't recognize `userId`
```

TypeScript would say: `Property 'userId' does not exist on type 'Request'`.

---

### **What Would Happen If We Didn’t Write This?**
If we didn’t write this, TypeScript would:
1. **Not recognize `req.userId`**:
   - TypeScript enforces strict typing. Since `userId` isn’t part of the default `Request` type, accessing or assigning it would cause a compile-time error.
   
   Example Error:
   ```plaintext
   Property 'userId' does not exist on type 'Request<ParamsDictionary, any, any, ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>'.
   ```

2. **You’d have to cast `req` manually**:
   Without extending the type, you would have to manually cast `req` to a custom type every time you access `userId`. For example:
   ```typescript
   (req as Request & { userId?: string }).userId = decoded.userTokenId;
   ```
   This is repetitive and prone to errors.

---

### **How Is the Type Being Overridden?**
The override happens through **TypeScript’s declaration merging**. Here's how it works:

1. **Existing Type Definition:**
   - The `@types/express` package defines a `namespace Express` and an interface `Request`.
   - By default, the `Request` interface doesn't have `userId`.

2. **Your Declaration Merges Into the Existing One:**
   - When you use `declare global { namespace Express { interface Request } }`, TypeScript merges your new properties (`userId?: string`) with the existing `Request` interface from the `@types/express` package.
   - Now, everywhere in your project, the `Request` interface includes `userId`.

This ensures that TypeScript recognizes `userId` as a valid property on `Request` without needing manual casting.

---

### **Summary**
- **Why write `declare global`?**
  To modify the global `Request` type from Express and add `userId` as a custom property.
  
- **What if we didn’t?**
  TypeScript would throw an error whenever you try to use `req.userId`.

- **How does it work?**
  Through **declaration merging**, TypeScript combines your additions with the existing `Request` interface from `@types/express`.
