Let’s break down exactly *what is happening under the hood* with **mount**, **rerender**, and **unmount** in this React component.

---

## 🧠 First Render (Initial Mount)

* `<App />` mounts.
* `count = 0`, `count2 = 0`.
* `<Counter />` mounts **for the first time**.

👉 Output in console:

```
Counter rendered
mount normal           // first useEffect ([]) → runs only once
mount for count2       // second useEffect ([count2]) → also runs because count2 is 0 initially
```

---

## 🟢 When You Click **Increase Button** → `setCount(...)`

* Only `count` changes.
* React **re-renders <App />**.
* `<Counter />` **also re-renders** because parent passed new props.
* But **count2 didn’t change**.

👉 Output in console:

```
Counter rendered
// NO Unmount
// NO mount normal (doesn't run again)
// NO Unmount for count2
// NO mount for count2 (because count2 didn’t change)
```

✅ Only re-render happens — **no unmount, no mount effects**.

---

## 🔴 When You Click **Decrease Button** → `setCount2(...)`

* `count2` changes.
* React re-renders `<App />`
* `<Counter />` re-renders
* Also, **second useEffect detects change in [count2]**
* So React **first runs cleanup (`return` → Unmount)** of that useEffect
* Then runs the new effect (`mount for count2`) again

👉 Output in console:

```
Counter rendered
Unmount for count2      // cleanup of count2 useEffect
mount for count2       // runs again because count2 changed
```

✅ Still mounted — only that specific effect is being cleaned & rerun

---

## ❗ When Does Full Unmount Actually Happen?

Only if `<Counter />` is **removed from the UI completely**, like with `{show && <Counter />}` and `setShow(false)`

In your current code → **Counter never unmounts fully**, only its **effect cleanups run**.

---

## Final Summary

| Action                        | What Happens | useEffect([]) | useEffect([count2]) |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------------- |
| First Render                  | Mount        | ✅ Mount       | ✅ Mount             |
| Increase Count                | Re-render    | ❌ Nothing     | ❌ Nothing           |
| Decrease Count2               | Re-render    | ❌ Nothing     | ✅ Cleanup → Mount   |
| Remove `<Counter />` entirely | Full Unmount | ✅ Unmount     | ✅ Unmount           |

### ✅ Corrected & Improved Explanation (You can keep this as your notes)

```js
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("mount normal");
    return () => {
        console.log("Unmount normal");
    }
}, [])
```

**✅ Explanation:**

* Runs **ONLY once** when `<Counter />` **mounts initially**.
* Will **NOT** run again on any re-render.
* The `"Unmount normal"` will **only run if the `<Counter />` component is completely removed from UI** (not on button clicks).
  ✅ Correct — it stays until the component is physically removed from DOM.

---

```js
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("mount for count2");
    return () => {
        console.log("Unmount for count2");
    }
}, [props.count2])
```

**✅ Explanation:**

* Runs **every time `props.count2` changes**.
* Before running again, React first runs the **cleanup (`Unmount for count2`)**.
  ✅ So your understanding is right — it’s like **disconnect → reconnect** on every `count2` update.

---

### 🔥 PERFECT FINAL SUMMARY (Memorize this)

| Dependency | When useEffect runs                    | When cleanup runs                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `[]`       | Only once → on mount                   | Only on final unmount                |
| `[count2]` | On mount + every time `count2` changes | Immediately **before** it runs again |
