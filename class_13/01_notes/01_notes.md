NoSQL databases are a type of database that work differently from the usual, table-based SQL databases. Unlike SQL databases, which store data in rows and columns (like a spreadsheet), NoSQL databases are more flexible in how they store and organize information. 

They’re especially good for handling large amounts of data or data that doesn’t fit well into a structured table format. Instead, they might use collections of documents (like files in folders), key-value pairs (like a dictionary), or graphs (which connect different pieces of data in a web).

In short:
- **NoSQL databases** don’t use the traditional table setup.
- They’re **better suited for complex or changing data** structures.
- They can **handle huge volumes of data** and are often used for big web applications and social media platforms.

A **schema** is like a blueprint or structure for organizing data in a database. It defines how data should be arranged, what type each piece of data should be, and the relationships between different pieces of data. 

In a traditional SQL (relational) database, the schema is fixed and carefully designed. For example, if you have a table for storing information about *users*, the schema might specify that each user has:
- a **name** (text),
- an **age** (number), 
- and an **email address** (text).

Once the schema is set, all data in that table must follow the same structure: each row needs a name, age, and email.

In **NoSQL databases**, the schema is often more flexible. You might not need to define a strict structure in advance, allowing you to add new types of data as needed without following a rigid format.

So, in summary:
- **Schema** = Structure for organizing and defining data in a database.
- **SQL databases** = Fixed schema, like a template everyone has to follow.
- **NoSQL databases** = Flexible schema, allowing different types of data without a set structure.
