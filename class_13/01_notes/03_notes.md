A **cluster** is a group of servers working together to act as a single system. In a database context, a cluster is used to store and manage data across multiple servers, rather than relying on just one. 

### Why Use a Cluster?

1. **Reliability**: If one server in the cluster fails, others can continue running, so thereâ€™s less chance of data being unavailable.
  
2. **Scalability**: As your application grows and needs more storage or processing power, you can add more servers to the cluster. This helps the database handle more traffic and store more data.

3. **Performance**: Clusters can handle large amounts of requests because they share the workload across multiple servers.

### Example

Imagine a popular social media app. A single server might struggle with the large number of users and data. By using a cluster of servers, the app can split its data across many machines, making it faster and more reliable.

So, a **cluster** is like a team of servers working together to handle big amounts of data and keep things running smoothly.
