### 1. **Importing Required Modules**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const { userModel, todoModel } = require("./02_database");
const { auth, JWT_SECRET } = require("./03_authentication");
```
- **mongoose**: A MongoDB object modeling tool, used for interacting with MongoDB databases.
- **userModel, todoModel**: These are likely Mongoose models imported from `02_database.js` for interacting with the "users" and "todos" collections in MongoDB.
- **auth, JWT_SECRET**: These are likely imported from `03_authentication.js`. `auth` is a middleware function used to check if a user is authenticated, and `JWT_SECRET` is the secret key used to sign the JWT.


### 2. **Database Connection Middleware**
```javascript
async function databaseConnections(req, res, next) {
    await mongoose.connect('mongodb+srv://debnathnihar14:nihar20052505@cluster0.kpsu7.mongodb.net/todo_app_database');
    next();
}
```
- **databaseConnections**: This middleware connects to a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas (using the provided connection string). Once the connection is established, it calls `next()` to pass control to the next middleware or route handler.

- **Database Connection is Asynchronous**: The connection to MongoDB using `mongoose.connect()` is an asynchronous operation. It takes some time to establish the connection to the database, especially if the database is hosted remotely (e.g., on MongoDB Atlas). 

### In Summary:
The `async` function ensures that the database connection is handled properly in an asynchronous, non-blocking manner. The `await` keyword ensures that the function waits for the database connection to complete before calling `next()`, which is essential for avoiding errors related to database access in subsequent routes or middleware.

### 4. **Setting up Middleware**
```javascript
app.use(databaseConnections);
```
- **databaseConnections**: The database connection middleware is applied globally for all incoming requests.

### 5. **Signup Route (`/signup`)**
```javascript
app.post("/signup", async (req, res) => {
    const { email, password, name } = req.body;

    const findUser = await userModel.findOne({ email: email });

    if (!findUser) {
        await userModel.create({ email, password, name });
        res.json({ messege: "You are signed up" });
    } else {
        return res.status(403).send({ messege: "An user already exists with the same email" });
    }
});
```


### Why `async` and `await` are Used Here:

1. **Database Query (`await userModel.findOne(...)`)**:
   - **`userModel.findOne({ email: email })`** is an **asynchronous** function because it queries the database, which can take some time depending on the network or the size of the database.
   - The `await` keyword ensures that the code execution pauses at this line until the query is completed and the result (`findUser`) is returned. Without `await`, the next lines of code would execute immediately, and the database query result might not be available yet.
   - Using `await` here allows the code to behave synchronously, even though it's actually performing an asynchronous operation. This makes the code easier to follow and avoids callback or promise chaining.

2. **Creating a New User (`await userModel.create(...)`)**:
   - **`userModel.create(...)`** is another asynchronous operation, as it creates a new document in the MongoDB database.
   - By using `await`, the code waits for the new user to be created before proceeding. This ensures that the user is successfully created before sending the response back to the client.



In the code, `findOne` and `create` are methods provided by **Mongoose**, the ODM (Object Document Mapper) library for MongoDB. These methods are used to interact with the MongoDB database through the Mongoose **model** (`userModel` in this case). Here's an explanation of each:

### 1. **`findOne()`**:
The `findOne()` method is used to search for a single document in a MongoDB collection that matches a given set of criteria. It returns the first document that matches the query, or `null` if no document is found.

#### Syntax:
```javascript
Model.findOne(query, projection, options, callback);
```

- **`query`**: The search criteria. In the code, it's `{ email: email }`, meaning the method will look for a document in the `users` collection where the `email` field matches the value of the `email` variable in the request body.
- **`projection`** (optional): Specifies which fields to include or exclude from the result. This isn't used in the code, so Mongoose will return the entire document.
- **`options`** (optional): Additional options for the query (e.g., sort, limit).
- **`callback`** (optional): A callback function that handles the result or error.

In the code:
```javascript
const findUser = await userModel.findOne({ email: email });
```
- **`findOne`** is checking if a user already exists in the database with the provided `email`. It returns the first matching document or `null` if no user is found.

If `findUser` is `null`, meaning no user with the given email was found, the code proceeds to create a new user. If `findUser` contains a user document, it indicates that the email is already taken, and the server responds with an error message.

### 2. **`create()`**:
The `create()` method is used to insert a new document into a MongoDB collection. It takes an object representing the new document and saves it to the database.

#### Syntax:
```javascript
Model.create(documents, callback);
```

- **`documents`**: An object (or an array of objects) representing the document(s) to be created in the collection. Each key-value pair corresponds to a field in the document.
- **`callback`** (optional): A callback function that is called when the document is created, handling any success or error.

In the code:
```javascript
await userModel.create({ email, password, name });
```


- **`create`** is called to create a new user in the database with the `email`, `password`, and `name` provided in the request body.
- The `await` keyword ensures the server waits for the database operation to finish before proceeding. Once the user is successfully created, the response is sent to the client confirming the signup.

### In Summary
- **`findOne()`**: Searches for a single document that matches the specified criteria (in this case, a user with the same email).
- **`create()`**: Creates a new document in the collection with the provided data (in this case, a new user with the specified email, password, and name).

These two methods are fundamental for performing **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in MongoDB using Mongoose.

### 7. **Create Todo Route (`/todo`)**
```javascript
app.post("/todo", auth, async (req, res) => {
    const { todo, done } = req.body;
    const userID = req._id;

    await todoModel.create({ todo, done, userId: userID });
    res.json({ messege: "Your todo had created." });
});
```
- This route allows a signed-in user to create a todo:
  - The `auth` middleware ensures the user is authenticated (the middleware will check the JWT token).
  - It extracts the `todo` and `done` properties from the request body and the user's `userID` from the request object (which should be added by the `auth` middleware).
  - It creates a new todo in the database associated with the authenticated user.
  - A success message is returned once the todo is created.

### 8. **Get Todos (`/my_todos`)**
```javascript
app.get("/my_todos", auth, async (req, res) => {
    const userID = req._id.toString();
    const allTodos = await todoModel.find({});
    const specificUserTodos = allTodos.filter(todo => todo.userId === userID);

    res.json({ specificUserTodos });
});
```
- This route fetches all todos for the authenticated user:
  - The `auth` middleware ensures the user is authenticated.
  - It fetches all todos from the `todoModel` and then filters the todos to return only those created by the authenticated user.
  - The filtered todos are returned in the response.


### Notes:
- Sensitive information like MongoDB credentials (`mongodb+srv://...`) should never be hardcoded; it's better to use environment variables for security purposes.
- The code uses a basic method of storing passwords as plain text, which is not secure. A real-world app should hash passwords before storing them (e.g., using `bcrypt`).
