That phrase is usually advice for **progress and long-term success**, whether in fitness, studying, coding, or even finance. Let’s unpack it slowly:

---

### 🔹 **“Go slow”**

* Don’t rush.
* Start at a manageable pace so you don’t burn out or get injured.
* Example: Instead of lifting very heavy weights right away, start lighter and build gradually.

---

### 🔹 **“Stay consistent”**

* Small, regular effort beats occasional big efforts.
* Consistency builds habits, habits build results.
* Example: Studying 1 hour daily is more effective than cramming 10 hours once a week.

---

### 🔹 **“Avoid the spikes”**

* Don’t have extreme ups and downs in effort or intensity.
* Spikes = sudden surges of motivation, overwork, then crashes (burnout, injury, or loss of interest).
* Example: Exercising super hard for a week, then quitting for a month because you overdid it.

---

### ✅ The Core Message

* Sustainable, steady growth > irregular bursts.
* Success is like **compound interest** — slow and steady effort multiplies over time.
