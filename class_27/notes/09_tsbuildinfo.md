# **1️⃣ What is `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`?**

* It’s a **metadata file** generated by TypeScript
* It stores information about the **last compilation** of your project
* Purpose: **speed up the next build**

---

# **2️⃣ When is it created?**

* When you enable **incremental builds** in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "incremental": true,
    "outDir": "./dist"
  }
}
```

* TypeScript will create `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` in the root of your project by default.

---

# **3️⃣ What is inside the file?**

Example content you posted:

```json
{"root":["./src/01_index.ts","./src/02_index.ts"],"version":"5.9.3"}
```

* `"root"` → The TS files that were compiled
* `"version"` → TypeScript compiler version used
* In bigger projects, it also contains:

  * Timestamps of last compilation
  * Hashes of compiled files
  * Dependency info between files

⚡ All this helps TypeScript know **which files have changed** and **only recompile those** instead of the whole project.

---

# **4️⃣ Why is it useful?**

* Saves **a lot of compilation time** for large projects
* Useful in **CI/CD pipelines** or frequent rebuilds
* Works with `tsc --build` or `tsc --incremental`

---

# **5️⃣ Can you delete it?**

Yes.

* Deleting `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` does **not break anything**
* TS will just do a **full rebuild** next time
* After rebuild, TS will generate it again

---

# ✅ **TL;DR**

* `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` = **metadata for incremental builds**
* Stores info like **which files were compiled, compiler version, hashes**
* Speeds up **future compilations**
* Safe to delete if needed
