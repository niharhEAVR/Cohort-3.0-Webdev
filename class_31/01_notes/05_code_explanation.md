This code is a **React app** that demonstrates how to interact with a WebSocket server. Let’s break it down step by step.

---

## **1. React Component Structure**
The component handles a **WebSocket connection** and allows the user to send and receive messages through the WebSocket server. Here's what each section of the code does:

### **useState for WebSocket**
```javascript
const [socket, setSocket] = useState();
```
- The `socket` state variable is used to store the WebSocket instance.
- The `setSocket` function is used to initialize the `socket` when the WebSocket connection is established in `useEffect`.

---

### **useRef for the Input Field**
```javascript
const inputRef = useRef();
```
- **Why use `useRef` here?**
  - It provides a **reference** to the input field DOM element (`<input>`).
  - Using `useRef` allows you to directly access the value of the input field without the need for React to track its state using `useState`. This is **more efficient** for cases where you just need to "read" the value of the input when a button is clicked.

---

### **Sending a Message**
```javascript
function sendMessege() {
  if (!socket) {
    return;
  }
  //@ts-ignore
  const messege = inputRef.current.value; // Read the input value using useRef
  //@ts-ignore
  socket.send(messege); // Send the message to the WebSocket server
}
```
- **What happens here?**
  - If the WebSocket (`socket`) exists, it reads the value from the input field (via `inputRef`) and sends it to the server using `socket.send()`.
  - If no WebSocket connection exists (`socket` is undefined), the function exits early with `return`.

---

### **Establishing the WebSocket Connection in useEffect**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080"); // Connect to the WebSocket server
  //@ts-ignore
  setSocket(ws); // Save the WebSocket instance in state
  
  ws.onmessage = (ev) => {
    alert(ev.data); // Alert the user when a message is received from the server
  };

  // Cleanup logic (optional): Close the WebSocket when the component unmounts
  return () => {
    ws.close();
  };
}, []);
```

#### **Why use `useEffect`?**
- **`useEffect` runs once when the component mounts (initial render).**  
  - WebSocket connections are **side effects**, meaning they operate outside the React render cycle.  
  - Initializing the WebSocket inside `useEffect` ensures that the connection is established only once when the component mounts.  
  - The empty dependency array (`[]`) ensures this effect only runs once.

#### **What happens here?**
1. A new WebSocket connection is created when the component mounts (`ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080")`).
2. The WebSocket is stored in the `socket` state using `setSocket(ws)`.
3. A `ws.onmessage` event handler is added to handle incoming messages from the server.  
   - When the server sends a message, the browser alerts the received data (`alert(ev.data)`).
4. Optionally, you can handle errors or close the WebSocket connection when the component unmounts using `ws.close()`.

### **Returning the UI**
```javascript
return (
  <>
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" placeholder='Messege...' />
      <button onClick={sendMessege}>Send</button>
    </div>
  </>
);
```
- **What happens here?**
  - `<input>`: A text field where the user types their message. The `ref={inputRef}` connects it to the `inputRef` reference, allowing direct access to its value.
  - `<button>`: A button that triggers the `sendMessege` function when clicked. This sends the user's input to the WebSocket server.

---

## **Why Use `useEffect` for the WebSocket Connection?**
1. **WebSocket connections are side effects**: They don’t directly involve the UI rendering process and need to be managed separately.
2. **One-time initialization**: The WebSocket connection should only be established once when the component loads, not on every re-render.
3. **Clean up on unmount**: Using `useEffect`, you can clean up the WebSocket connection when the component unmounts by closing it (`ws.close()`), preventing memory leaks.

---

## **Why Use `useRef` for the Input Field?**
1. **Direct DOM Access**: `useRef` provides direct access to the underlying DOM element (the input field). This is faster and simpler than managing the value through `useState`.
   - **Without `useRef`**, you would need to track the input field’s value with a state variable (`useState`) and update the state on every keystroke.
2. **Avoid Re-renders**: Using `useState` would trigger a re-render every time the input value changes, which is unnecessary here since the value is only needed when the button is clicked.
3. **Efficiency**: `useRef` is efficient when you only need to read the value of an element occasionally.

---

## **How It Works as a Whole**
1. When the app loads:
   - A WebSocket connection is created in `useEffect`.
   - The server can send messages to the client, which are shown as alerts.
2. The user types a message into the input field.
3. When the "Send" button is clicked:
   - The `sendMessege` function reads the input value using `inputRef` and sends it to the server over the WebSocket connection.
