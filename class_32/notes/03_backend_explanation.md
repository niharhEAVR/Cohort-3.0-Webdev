This code demonstrates a simple WebSocket-based chat server where users can join specific rooms and send messages visible only to users in the same room. Let’s break this down thoroughly.

---

### **Imports and Initialization**

```javascript
import { WebSocketServer, WebSocket } from "ws";
const ws = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });
```

1. **Importing WebSocket Server**:
   - `WebSocketServer` and `WebSocket` are classes from the `ws` library used to create WebSocket servers and handle WebSocket connections.

2. **Creating WebSocket Server**:
   - `const ws = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });`:
     - Creates a WebSocket server listening on port `8080`.
     - Clients can connect to `ws://localhost:8080`.

---

### **User Interface and Socket Management**

```javascript
interface User {
    socket: WebSocket;
    room: string;
}
let allSockets: User[] = [];
```

1. **Interface `User`**:
   - This defines the shape of each user in the `allSockets` array.
   - `User` has two properties:
     - `socket`: The WebSocket connection for this user.
     - `room`: The room this user is currently in.

2. **`allSockets` Array**:
   - `let allSockets: User[] = [];`:
     - An array to track connected users and their room assignments.
     - Initially empty; users are added dynamically.

---

### **Handling Connections**

```javascript
ws.on("connection", function connection(socket) {
```

- **Event Listener for Connections**:
  - `ws.on("connection", ...)` listens for new client connections.
  - When a client connects, the `socket` argument represents their WebSocket connection.
  - Initially, no user is added to `allSockets` until they specify a room to join.

---

### **Handling Messages from Clients**

```javascript
socket.on("message", (data) => {
```

- **Event Listener for Messages**:
  - `socket.on("message", ...)` listens for messages sent by the client.
  - `data` is the raw message received from the client. It's usually a string.

---

#### **Parsing Incoming Data**

```javascript
const parsedMessage = JSON.parse(data as unknown as string);
```

1. **Converting String to Object**:
   - `data` is received as a JSON string, e.g., `{ "type": "join", "payload": { "roomId": "red" } }`.
   - `JSON.parse(...)` converts this string into a JavaScript object:
     - Example Input: 
       ```json
       { "type": "join", "payload": { "roomId": "red" } }
       ```
     - Example Output:
       ```javascript
       { type: "join", payload: { roomId: "red" } }
       ```

2. **Structure of Parsed Message**:
   - `type`: Describes the action (`"join"` or `"chat"`).
   - `payload`: Contains additional details related to the action.

---

### **Joining a Room**

```javascript
if (parsedMessage.type === "join") {
    allSockets.push({
        socket,
        room: parsedMessage.payload.roomId
    });
}
```

1. **Condition for Joining**:
   - If the `type` is `"join"`, the client wants to join a room.

2. **Adding User to `allSockets`**:
   - `allSockets.push(...)` adds the client and their room to the `allSockets` array.
   - Example:
     - Client sends:
       ```json
       { "type": "join", "payload": { "roomId": "red" } }
       ```
     - `allSockets` after the message:
       ```javascript
       [
           { socket: <WebSocket>, room: "red" }
       ]
       ```

---

### **Sending Messages**

```javascript
if (parsedMessage.type === "chat") {
    const currentUserRoom = allSockets.find(user => user.socket == socket)?.room;
```

1. **Condition for Sending Chat Messages**:
   - If `type` is `"chat"`, the client is sending a message to their room.

2. **Finding the User’s Room**:
   - `allSockets.find(...)` locates the user in the `allSockets` array by matching their `socket`.
   - `?.room` retrieves the `room` property of the found user.

---

#### **Broadcasting Messages**

```javascript
allSockets.forEach(user => {
    if (user.room === currentUserRoom && user.socket !== socket) {
        user.socket.send(parsedMessage.payload.message);
    }
});
```

1. **Iterating Over Users**:
   - `allSockets.forEach(...)` loops through all connected users.

2. **Condition for Broadcasting**:
   - `user.room === currentUserRoom` ensures the message is sent only to users in the same room.
   - `user.socket !== socket` prevents sending the message back to the sender.

3. **Sending the Message**:
   - `user.socket.send(...)` sends the message to the client’s WebSocket.

---

### **Example Interaction**

#### **Client Joins a Room**

1. Client sends:
   ```json
   { "type": "join", "payload": { "roomId": "red" } }
   ```
2. Server updates `allSockets`:
   ```javascript
   [
       { socket: <WebSocket>, room: "red" }
   ]
   ```

---

#### **Client Sends a Chat Message**

1. Client sends:
   ```json
   { "type": "chat", "payload": { "message": "Hello Red Room!" } }
   ```
2. Server:
   - Finds the user’s room (`"red"`).
   - Sends `"Hello Red Room!"` to all other users in `"red"`.

---

### **Message Structure (JSON)**

**Join Room**:
```json
{
    "type": "join",
    "payload": {
        "roomId": "red"
    }
}
```

**Chat Message**:
```json
{
    "type": "chat",
    "payload": {
        "message": "Hello Red Room!"
    }
}
```

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Room-Based Messaging**:
   - Users are organized into rooms, and messages are only sent to users in the same room.

2. **WebSocket Events**:
   - `on("message")`: Receives messages from clients.
   - `send(message)`: Sends messages to clients.

3. **Dynamic User Management**:
   - Users are stored dynamically in the `allSockets` array.
