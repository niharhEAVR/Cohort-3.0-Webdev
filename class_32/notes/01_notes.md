This code demonstrates the implementation of a simple WebSocket-based backend for a chat-like application using the `ws` library in Node.js. Letâ€™s break it down step by step:

---

### 1. **Importing Required Modules**
```javascript
import { WebSocketServer, WebSocket } from "ws";
```
- `WebSocketServer`: A class provided by the `ws` library to create a WebSocket server.
- `WebSocket`: The WebSocket class represents a single WebSocket connection. It is used for communication with the clients.

---

### 2. **Creating the WebSocket Server**
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });
```
- This initializes a WebSocket server that listens for connections on port `8080`.
- The server will handle WebSocket protocol messages, establishing persistent connections between clients and the server.

---

### 3. **Managing All Connections**
```javascript
let allSockets: WebSocket[] = [];
```
- `allSockets` is an array that will store all active WebSocket connections (or sockets).
- This allows the server to keep track of connected clients and broadcast messages to all of them as needed.

---

### 4. **Handling New Connections**
```javascript
ws.on("connection", function connection(socket) {
    allSockets.push(socket);
    ...
});
```
- The `connection` event is fired whenever a new client connects to the WebSocket server.
- The `socket` parameter represents the connection to the specific client.
- Each new `socket` (client connection) is added to the `allSockets` array so the server can interact with it later.

---

### 5. **Listening for Messages**
```javascript
socket.on("message", (data) => {
    ...
});
```
- The `message` event is fired when the server receives a message from a connected client.
- `data` contains the message sent by the client, typically in binary or string format.
- The `data.toString()` ensures the message is treated as a string.

---

### 6. **Broadcasting Messages**
```javascript
allSockets.forEach(s => {
    if (s !== socket) {
        s.send(data.toString());
    }
});
```
- The server iterates through all active connections stored in `allSockets`.
- For each connection `s`, it checks if `s` is **not** the sender (`socket`).
    - This ensures the message is sent to all other clients except the one that sent the message.
- If the connection is not the sender, the message is forwarded to the client using `s.send(data.toString())`.

---

### 7. **Putting It All Together**
This code creates a simple chat server where:
1. Clients connect to the WebSocket server on `ws://localhost:8080`.
2. When one client sends a message, the server:
   - Receives the message.
   - Forwards it to all other connected clients.
3. As more clients connect, their connections are added to `allSockets`, enabling real-time message sharing.

---

### **Testing with Tools**
- **Postman or Hoppscotch**:
  - These tools can simulate WebSocket connections by specifying the WebSocket URL (e.g., `ws://localhost:8080`).
  - You can open two separate connections and send messages to see them broadcasted between connections.
  
---

### **Example Workflow**
1. **Client 1** connects and sends a message: `"Hello from Client 1"`.
2. The server receives this message and forwards it to all other connected clients (in this case, **Client 2**, etc.).
3. **Client 2** receives the message `"Hello from Client 1"`.
4. Similarly, if **Client 2** sends a message, it will be broadcast to all other clients (excluding itself).

This implementation lays the foundation for real-time chat applications or any system requiring live updates, such as multiplayer games, stock tickers, or collaborative tools.
