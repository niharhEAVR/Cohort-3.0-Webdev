You're welcome! It's great that you're thinking about security before pushing code to GitHub. Here’s what you should do next to protect your sensitive information (like MongoDB credentials) and make your code more secure:

### 1. **Remove Sensitive Information from Your Code**
   - **Remove** the MongoDB connection string from the code.
   - Any other sensitive data (like passwords, API keys, etc.) should also be removed.

   Replace this:
   ```javascript
   mongoose.connect('mongodb+srv://debnathnihar14:nihar20052505@cluster0.kpsu7.mongodb.net/todo_app_database')
   ```
   with something like this:
   ```javascript
   mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI);
   ```

### 2. **Use Environment Variables**
   - **Install `dotenv`**: This allows you to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

     Run the following to install it:
     ```bash
     npm install dotenv
     ```

   - **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of your project and add the MongoDB connection string there:
     ```
     MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://debnathnihar14:nihar20052505@cluster0.kpsu7.mongodb.net/todo_app_database
     ```

   - **Load Environment Variables in Your Code**: At the top of your main application file (e.g., `app.js`), add this line to load the `.env` file:
     ```javascript
     require('dotenv').config();
     ```

   Now, the connection string will be loaded securely from the `.env` file, instead of being hardcoded in your code.

### 3. **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`**
   You don’t want to accidentally commit your `.env` file to GitHub, so you should add it to your `.gitignore` file. If you don’t already have a `.gitignore` file, create one in the root of your project.

   Add this line to your `.gitignore`:
   ```
   .env
   ```

   This ensures that sensitive information in `.env` doesn’t get pushed to GitHub.

### 4. **Change Your MongoDB Password**
   Since the credentials were exposed (even if temporarily), you should **immediately rotate your MongoDB credentials** to prevent unauthorized access. Change your password on MongoDB Atlas (or whichever service you’re using) and update the `.env` file with the new credentials.

### 5. **Push Your Changes**
   - After making the changes, commit and push your code to GitHub, but **ensure that `.env` is not included in your commits**.
   - If you had already pushed the sensitive credentials before realizing the issue, **delete** the previous commits containing those credentials from Git history using `git rebase` or `git filter-branch`. This is a more advanced step, and you can find detailed guides on how to do this.

### 6. **Verify Security**
   - **Check your GitHub repository**: Make sure that no sensitive information (such as the MongoDB connection string) is available publicly.
   - **Check MongoDB access logs**: It’s a good idea to monitor your MongoDB logs for any unauthorized access attempts, especially if the credentials were exposed for some time.

### In Summary:
1. **Remove sensitive information** from the code.
2. **Use environment variables** to securely store credentials.
3. **Create a `.env` file** and load it with `dotenv`.
4. **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`** to avoid pushing sensitive data to GitHub.
5. **Change your MongoDB credentials** and update your `.env` file.
6. **Push your changes** to GitHub, making sure `.env` is excluded.

Following these steps ensures that your sensitive data is protected and follows best security practices. Let me know if you need help with any of the steps!
