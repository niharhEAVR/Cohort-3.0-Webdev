If `console.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL)` is showing `undefined`, this means the environment variable isn't being loaded correctly from your `.env` file. Here are some troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue:

### 1. **Ensure `dotenv` is installed**
Make sure you have installed the `dotenv` package. Run this command in your project directory:
```bash
npm install dotenv
```

### 2. **Check if `.env` File Exists in the Root Directory**
Ensure the `.env` file is located in the **root directory** of your project, at the same level as your `package.json` file. The file should be named exactly `.env`, not `env` or `.env.txt`.

Example of project structure:
```
/your-project
    .env
    /node_modules
    package.json
    app.js (or your main file)
```

### 3. **Verify the `.env` File Syntax**
Check the syntax in your `.env` file. It should look like this:
```
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
```

- There should be **no spaces** around the `=` sign.
- Double-check the file for any extra characters, spaces, or hidden characters (such as newline characters).

### 4. **Require `dotenv` at the Top of the File**
Ensure you are calling `require('dotenv').config();` **at the very top of your file**, before any other code that uses environment variables.

Example:
```javascript
require('dotenv').config();  // This should be the first line in your file

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
console.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL);  // Check if the variable is being loaded
```

### 5. **Restart Your Server**
After making changes to your `.env` file, **restart your server**. If youâ€™re using `nodemon`, it should automatically restart, but if not, you may need to stop the current server and start it again:
```bash
npm start  # or whatever command you use to start your server
```

### 6. **Check File Permissions**
Ensure the `.env` file has the correct permissions and is accessible to your Node.js process.

### 7. **Try Logging All Environment Variables**
To confirm whether other environment variables are loaded correctly, log all the environment variables:
```javascript
console.log(process.env);  // Log all environment variables
```

If the environment variables are not loading at all, this could indicate an issue with how `dotenv` is being loaded or the `.env` file's location.

### 8. **Ensure `.env` is Not Ignored in `.gitignore`**
Check that `.env` is **not** accidentally ignored by your version control system (like Git). Ensure your `.gitignore` file does not contain `.env`.

### 9. **Check for Hidden Characters**
Sometimes, hidden characters or encoding issues can cause problems in `.env` files, especially if the file was edited in a non-standard editor. Ensure the file is saved in UTF-8 encoding and free of hidden characters.

### 10. **Alternative Debugging**
If none of the above steps resolve the issue, try hardcoding the value directly in the code temporarily to check if the connection works:

```javascript
const databaseUrl = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase';  // Hardcode temporarily
console.log(databaseUrl);
```

### Summary:
- **Ensure `dotenv` is installed**.
- **Make sure the `.env` file is in the root directory** and correctly formatted.
- **Call `dotenv.config()`** at the top of the file.
- **Restart the server** to reload environment variables.
- **Log all environment variables** to check if anything else is being loaded.

By following these steps, you should be able to figure out why `process.env.DATABASE_URL` is showing as `undefined` and fix the issue.

Ah, that makes sense! The `.env` file needs to be in the root directory of your project, where your main application file (like `app.js`) and `package.json` are located. Once you move it to the correct directory, your environment variables should load properly, and the issue with `process.env.DATABASE_URL` being `undefined` should be resolved.
