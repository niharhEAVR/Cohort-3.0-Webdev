To check if a website is built with **Express.js**, you can look for certain clues in the HTTP headers, JavaScript, or the behavior of the site. Here are some methods:

To apply the approach of checking for unnecessary routes and finding the "Cannot GET /<route>" message to detect Express, follow these steps:

### 1. **Choose an Unlikely URL Path**
   - Think of a URL path that probably doesn’t exist on the site, like `/random12345` or `/nonexistent-path`.
   - This should be something that’s very unlikely to be a real route.

### 2. **Test the Path Manually**
   - In your browser, add this path to the base URL of the website, like `https://example.com/random12345`.
   - Hit enter, and check the response on the page.
   - If you see `Cannot GET /random12345`, this suggests that the server might be using Express, as this is Express’s default message for undefined routes.

### 3. **Use Developer Tools to Inspect the Response**
   - If you don’t see the "Cannot GET" message, inspect the network response and look at the returned HTTP status code.
   - Express typically returns a `404` status code with the "Cannot GET" message when a route isn’t found. This behavior can be a strong hint.

### 4. **Automate the Process (Optional)**
   - If you’re familiar with Node.js, you can automate this by writing a simple script that checks for this response on multiple routes.

   Here’s a basic script using **Node.js** and **Axios** to check for the "Cannot GET" message:

   ```javascript
   const axios = require('axios');

   async function checkRoute(url, route) {
       try {
           const response = await axios.get(`${url}/${route}`);
       } catch (error) {
           if (error.response && error.response.data.includes("Cannot GET")) {
               console.log(`The website at ${url} is likely built with Express.`);
           } else {
               console.log(`No 'Cannot GET' message for ${url}/${route}.`);
           }
       }
   }

   // Test the approach on a website
   checkRoute("https://example.com", "random12345");
   ```

### Important Notes:
   - **Permission & Privacy**: This approach is generally safe for public websites, but repeatedly probing routes could raise security flags. Avoid excessive requests.
   - **Variations**: Some developers customize the default Express error handling, so the absence of "Cannot GET" does not always mean Express isn’t used.

### 1. **Check HTTP Headers**
   - When a server responds, it usually includes HTTP headers in its response. Express often includes a header like `X-Powered-By` with the value `Express` by default (unless the developer has removed it for security reasons).
   - You can inspect HTTP headers using tools like **Developer Tools** in your browser, **cURL**, or **Postman**.

   **Using Browser DevTools**:
   1. Open the website in Chrome.
   2. Right-click on the page and select **Inspect**.
   3. Go to the **Network** tab, refresh the page, and click on the main request (usually the first item).
   4. Check the **Headers** section for `X-Powered-By`. If you see something like `X-Powered-By: Express`, it’s likely the site is using Express.

   **Using cURL**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://example.com
   ```
   Look for `X-Powered-By: Express` in the output headers.

   **Note**: Many developers disable or customize the `X-Powered-By` header for security, so its absence doesn’t necessarily mean the site isn’t using Express.

### 2. **Look for Express-specific Routing Patterns**
   - Many Express applications follow RESTful URL patterns like `/api/users`, `/auth/login`, or similar routes.
   - If you see routes like these in the site’s URL structure or API requests, it might be a hint that the backend uses Express (or another Node.js-based framework).

### 3. **Use Online Detection Tools**
   - Websites like **Wappalyzer** or **BuiltWith** can detect the tech stack of a site and often recognize Express if it’s being used. 
   - Just go to the website, enter the URL, and check for "Express" in the detected technologies.

### 4. **Check for Error Messages**
   - If you encounter an error page (e.g., a 404 or 500 error), sometimes Express will display an error message that reveals it as the server framework.
   - For example, you might see an error page that explicitly mentions "Express" or has a default Express error message if the developer hasn’t customized it.

### 5. **Test for Default Express Error Pages (Caution)**
   - If you try to access a route that doesn’t exist (e.g., `https://example.com/nonexistentroute`), you may see a default 404 or 500 page that mentions Express.
   - However, be cautious with this approach as probing websites without permission can sometimes trigger security measures.

### Summary
Checking for the `X-Powered-By` header or using tools like **Wappalyzer** are the quickest ways. But if Express isn’t explicitly revealed, it can be challenging to confirm for sure.
