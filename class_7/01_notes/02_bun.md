### ðŸ”¹ What is **Bun**?

**Bun** is a modern **JavaScript runtime**, similar to **Node.js** and **Deno**, but built with performance and developer experience in mind.

* Itâ€™s powered by **JavaScriptCore** (the JS engine from Safari) instead of V8 (used in Node.js).
* It comes as an **all-in-one toolkit**:

  * Runtime (like Node.js)
  * Package manager (like npm/yarn/pnpm)
  * Bundler (like webpack/rollup/esbuild)
  * Test runner (like Jest/Vitest)

So instead of installing multiple tools, Bun tries to give everything in one package.

### ðŸ”¹ Where do we need Bun?

Youâ€™d use Bun when you want:

1. **High performance** â€“ Bun is optimized for speed (startup time, package installs, and server response times).
2. **Faster package management** â€“ Instead of `npm install`, you can use `bun install` (much faster).
3. **Web development** â€“ Bunâ€™s built-in bundler helps you handle TypeScript, JSX, CSS, etc., without extra config.
4. **Server-side apps** â€“ You can write HTTP servers like with Express, but faster.
5. **Testing** â€“ Bun includes a test runner, so you donâ€™t need Jest/Mocha separately.
6. **All-in-one workflow** â€“ If you donâ€™t want to juggle npm + webpack + ts-node + jest, Bun handles all of it.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:

* **Node.js** = battle-tested, huge ecosystem, but slower in some tasks.
* **Deno** = secure and modern, but smaller ecosystem.
* **Bun** = fastest and all-in-one, but still newer and evolving.
