`index.mjs` is a filename commonly used in JavaScript projects that utilize ECMAScript modules (ESM). The `.mjs` extension indicates that the file is a module file, which allows the use of `import` and `export` statements for modular programming. Here are a few key points about `index.mjs`:

1. **Module System**: It utilizes the ES module system, which is the standard for modular JavaScript. This allows for better organization of code, easier maintenance, and improved code reusability.

2. **Default Entry Point**: In many projects, especially those structured as libraries or frameworks, `index.mjs` serves as the default entry point. When you import a directory, Node.js will look for `index.mjs` by default.

3. **Usage in Node.js**: Starting from Node.js 12, support for ESM was introduced. By naming a file with the `.mjs` extension, you can run it as an ESM module, enabling modern JavaScript features.

4. **Example Content**:
   ```javascript
   // index.mjs
   export function greet(name) {
       return `Hello, ${name}!`;
   }

   export const pi = 3.14;
   ```

5. **Importing**:
   You can import functions or variables from `index.mjs` in another module like this:
   ```javascript
   import { greet, pi } from './index.mjs';

   console.log(greet('World')); // Outputs: Hello, World!
   console.log(pi); // Outputs: 3.14
   ```

Overall, `index.mjs` is part of the growing ecosystem of JavaScript that embraces modular programming and the latest language features.
