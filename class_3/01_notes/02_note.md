The quote **“concurrency is not parallelism”** comes from a famous talk by Rob Pike (one of the creators of Go). It highlights a key distinction in computing:

---

### 🔹 **Concurrency**

* About **structure**: how a program is organized to handle multiple tasks at once.
* It means *dealing with multiple things at the same time* conceptually.
* Tasks may be broken into smaller units and interleaved (like multitasking), even on a **single CPU core**.
* Example: An OS switching between running your browser, music player, and editor on one CPU core. They aren’t truly simultaneous, but they progress concurrently.

---

### 🔹 **Parallelism**

* About **execution**: actually running multiple tasks at the same time.
* Requires **multiple processors/cores**.
* Example: A large array split into chunks and processed simultaneously by 4 CPU cores. All chunks are being computed **in parallel**.

### 🔹 The Difference

* **Concurrency** is a way to structure a program so that it can handle many things *at once* (like juggling tasks).
* **Parallelism** is when multiple tasks are *physically executed at the same time*.
* Concurrency can exist **without** parallelism (e.g., cooperative multitasking on a single core).
* Parallelism usually **benefits from** concurrency (since tasks must be broken up and coordinated), but they’re not the same.

👉 **Analogy:**

* **Concurrency:** A single waiter managing many tables, moving between them quickly.
* **Parallelism:** Multiple waiters serving tables at the same time.
