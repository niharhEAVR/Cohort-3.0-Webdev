Authentication on websites is the process of verifying a user's identity to grant them access to resources, accounts, or personalized content. There are several common ways authentication is implemented, each with different technologies and security measures.

### 1. **Username and Password Authentication**
   - **Step 1**: The user enters a username and password on a login page.
   - **Step 2**: The website server checks the entered information against stored credentials (usually in a database).
   - **Step 3**: If the credentials match, the server generates a session (or token) to indicate the user is authenticated.
   - **Step 4**: The session ID or token is stored in the browser as a **cookie** or **session storage**, allowing the user to stay logged in for the session duration.

   **Security Measures**: 
   - Hashing and salting passwords before storing them in the database.
   - Rate limiting login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

### 2. **Token-Based Authentication**
   - **Step 1**: Similar to username-password authentication, the user logs in with their credentials.
   - **Step 2**: The server verifies the credentials and, if correct, issues a **token** (like a JWT - JSON Web Token).
   - **Step 3**: The token is sent back to the client (usually stored in local storage or a cookie).
   - **Step 4**: The client includes this token in the **Authorization** header of future requests to prove its identity without needing to log in again.

   **Security Measures**:
   - Using HTTPS to encrypt the token in transit.
   - Setting expiration times on tokens and refreshing them periodically.
   - Using secure cookies or HTTP-only flags to store tokens, which prevents JavaScript from accessing them directly.

### 3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - In addition to the username and password, 2FA requires a **second factor** (like a one-time code sent via SMS or an authenticator app).
   - After the initial credentials are verified, the server asks for the code.
   - The user enters the code, which the server verifies against a generated or stored code.

   **Security Measures**:
   - Ensuring codes are unique and time-bound.
   - Using authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator) for higher security than SMS.

### 4. **OAuth (Third-Party Authentication)**
   - OAuth allows users to log in via a third-party account (e.g., Google, Facebook).
   - **Step 1**: The user clicks "Login with Google."
   - **Step 2**: They are redirected to Google’s authentication page, where they grant permission for the website to access their profile.
   - **Step 3**: Google sends an **authorization code** back to the website.
   - **Step 4**: The website uses this code to request an **access token** from Google.
   - **Step 5**: The token verifies the user and allows them access to the website.

   **Security Measures**:
   - Using tokens with restricted permissions.
   - Configuring OAuth scopes to control what data the website can access.

### 5. **Session-Based Authentication**
   - The server creates a session on successful login and assigns a unique **session ID** to the user.
   - The session ID is stored in a cookie and sent with each request.
   - The server uses this session ID to track the user's authenticated session.

   **Security Measures**:
   - Setting session expiration times.
   - Using HTTPS and secure cookies to prevent session hijacking.
   - Implementing session invalidation (e.g., logging out).

### 6. **Biometric Authentication**
   - Biometrics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice can authenticate users on websites, though it’s less common.
   - Biometrics are usually used in conjunction with another method for extra security.

   **Security Measures**:
   - Biometric data is stored and processed in a way that doesn’t expose actual fingerprints or facial images but rather unique biometric templates.
   - Biometric authentication is generally local (processed on the user's device).

### Common Security Practices
1. **HTTPS**: Encrypts the communication between the server and client, protecting sensitive information.
2. **Hashing Passwords**: Passwords are hashed before storing to prevent direct access.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an extra layer, often combining something the user knows (password) and something they have (phone).
4. **Access Control**: Sets rules for different user roles, so only certain users can access sensitive information.

Each method can be used alone or combined to improve security based on the website's needs. Let me know if you'd like more details on any specific approach!

#  Today we are learning Token-Based Authentication

To see an example of **Token-Based Authentication** on a website, here’s what you could look for, and I'll explain how you can view this in action using developer tools in a browser.

### How Token-Based Authentication Works in Practice
Imagine a scenario on a website where you log in with your username and password. After verifying your credentials, the server responds with a **token** (often a JWT - JSON Web Token) which your browser stores and includes in future requests.

The process looks like this:
1. **Login Request**: The user sends a POST request with login credentials (username/password).
2. **Server Verifies and Issues Token**: If correct, the server generates a token and sends it back.
3. **Client Stores the Token**: The browser stores this token, typically in local storage or a secure cookie.
4. **Authenticated Requests**: For future requests, the client includes this token in the **Authorization header**.

Here’s what a token might look like:
```json
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### How to Observe Token-Based Authentication on a Website

1. **Login to a Website Using Developer Tools**
   - Open **Developer Tools** in your browser (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`).
   - Go to the **Network** tab to view all network requests.
   - Log in to a website that uses token-based authentication (like many web apps or API-based sites).

2. **Find the Login Request**
   - In the Network tab, look for the **login request** (often a POST request to `/login` or `/authenticate`).
   - Click on this request, and view the **Response**. The response may contain a token (usually a JWT) if authentication is successful.

3. **Observe the Token Storage**
   - After receiving the token, websites often store it in **local storage** or **session storage**.
   - Go to the **Application** tab in Developer Tools.
   - Look under **Local Storage** or **Session Storage** to see if there's a token stored, often labeled as something like `authToken`, `token`, or `jwt`.

4. **Check for the Token in Future Requests**
   - After logging in, go back to the Network tab.
   - Refresh the page or trigger a new request on the website.
   - Look for the **Authorization** header in the request headers of new requests. It should contain a `Bearer` token, indicating the website is using it for authenticated access.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's say you’re testing this on a web app like GitHub:

1. **Login**: Open Developer Tools, go to the Network tab, and log in to GitHub.
2. **Inspect**: Look for a request called something like `login` or `auth`.
3. **Find Token**: See if the response or headers contain an authorization token.
4. **Application Tab**: After logging in, check the Application tab to see if the token is stored.
5. **Look at Requests**: Trigger a page refresh or go to a different section of GitHub. Check the Authorization header in requests; you may see a token used to authenticate your access to protected resources.

This approach works on most websites that use token-based authentication and is great for learning about HTTP headers and token handling!
