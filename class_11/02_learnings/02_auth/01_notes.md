The process of sending a token in the `Authorization` header typically involves the following steps. This process enables the client (like a frontend app or a tool like Postman) to securely send a token to authenticate a request without requiring the username and password each time.

### Step-by-Step Token Authentication Process

1. **Client Requests Token**:
   - When the client (a web app, mobile app, or tool) logs in, it sends the username and password to the `/signin` endpoint.
   - If the login is successful, the server generates a unique token and sends it back in the response.

2. **Client Stores the Token**:
   - After receiving the token, the client stores it, typically in a secure location:
     - **Web apps**: Store the token in memory, a cookie, or local storage (with appropriate security considerations).
     - **Mobile apps**: Store it in a secure storage solution like Keychain (iOS) or Keystore (Android).
   - This token represents the client’s authentication status. The client now includes this token in the `Authorization` header for protected requests, like accessing the `/dashboard`.

3. **Client Sends Token with Protected Requests**:
   - When the client makes a request to a protected route, such as `/dashboard`, it includes the token in the `Authorization` header like this:
     ```
     Authorization: abcd1234efgh5678ijkl9012mnop3456
     ```
   - The `Authorization` header typically follows the format:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <token>
     ```
   - In this setup, though, we’re simply sending the token without the `Bearer` keyword, which is also acceptable if the server expects this format.

4. **Server Receives and Validates the Token**:
   - When the server receives the request, it checks the `Authorization` header.
   - In the code:
     ```javascript
     const token = req.headers.authorization;
     ```
     - Here, `req.headers.authorization` retrieves the token.
   - The server then looks for a user in the `users` array with a matching `Token` field. If a match is found, the server knows the request is from an authenticated client.

5. **Server Sends a Response Based on Token Validity**:
   - If the token is valid, the server responds with the protected data (like the dashboard information).
   - If the token is missing, incorrect, or expired, the server returns a `401 Unauthorized` status, denying access.

### Example in Practice with Postman

1. **Login Request**:
   - In Postman, the client sends a POST request to `/signin` with the body:
     ```json
     {
       "userName": "exampleUser",
       "password": "examplePassword"
     }
     ```
   - Postman receives a token in the response.

2. **Protected Route Request**:
   - The client then makes a GET request to `/dashboard`.
   - In the headers section of Postman, the client adds:
     ```
     Authorization: abcd1234efgh5678ijkl9012mnop3456
     ```
   - The server reads the token from this header, validates it, and returns the user’s dashboard data.

This method keeps the authentication process efficient by allowing the client to authenticate itself using a token instead of repeatedly sending sensitive information like passwords.

The token storage process is separate on the client and server sides:

1. **Server-Side Storage (in-memory users array)**:
   - When the server creates the token during `/signin`, it adds the token to the `users` array as part of the user object. This is **only on the server**, and the token is stored in the server’s memory (in this case, within the `users` array).
   - This stored token allows the server to verify incoming requests by checking if the token in the `Authorization` header matches any token in the `users` array.

2. **Client-Side Storage (local storage, cookies, or memory)**:
   - After the server generates the token, it sends the token to the client as part of the response.
   - The **client’s application (such as a web browser or mobile app)** then decides where to store this token, depending on the type of application:
     - **Web apps**: The token is usually stored in local storage, session storage, or cookies, based on the client’s code.
     - **Mobile apps**: The token may be saved in secure storage solutions like Keychain (iOS) or Keystore (Android).
   - This client-side storage process is typically coded in the frontend application. When the frontend receives the token in the response, it directly saves it in local storage, session storage, or cookies, as per the developer's implementation.


### Summary
- **Server Side**: Stores the token in `users` for reference and verification.
- **Client Side**: Stores the token in local storage, cookies, or another secure area as instructed by client code to allow future authenticated requests. 

Both storage methods work together to make authentication smooth: the server keeps a record for verification, while the client holds a copy to send in headers for protected routes.

Got it! In the context of your **Express** application, when we refer to the **client**, we are typically talking about the **user's web browser** or any other application (like a mobile app) that interacts with your **Express server** via HTTP requests.

### Breakdown of Client in Express:

1. **Client in Express**:
   - The **client** is the entity that makes requests to your Express server. This could be a **web browser** or any software that makes HTTP requests (using tools like `fetch`, `axios`, or Postman).
   - The client sends data to your server and expects a response from the server, like authentication tokens, user data, or success/error messages.

2. **Client-Side Code (Frontend)**:
   - In a typical web application, the frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) runs on the **client**. This is what you see when you open a website in a browser (for example, the website interface).
   - The frontend (client) sends HTTP requests (like POST to `/signin` or GET to `/dashboard`) to your Express server using JavaScript (e.g., `fetch` or `axios`).
   - After receiving a response (e.g., the authentication token), the client stores it (usually in `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or a cookie) for future use.

3. **Server-Side Code (Express)**:
   - The **Express server** (your backend) listens for incoming requests, processes them (like authenticating users, querying a database, etc.), and sends responses back to the client.
   - For example, when a client makes a `POST` request to `/signin`, the server processes the request, verifies the credentials, and sends back a response containing the authentication token.


### Key Points:
- **Client**: The web browser or any app that sends requests to the Express server.
- **Client-Side (Frontend)**: The code running on the client (browser or app), where you manage UI and interact with the server (e.g., saving tokens in `localStorage`).
- **Server-Side (Express)**: The Express application that listens for client requests, processes them, and returns responses.
- **Token Storage**: The token is not stored automatically on the client side; it must be explicitly saved in the frontend (e.g., in `localStorage`, cookies, or in-memory storage).

So, in your case, the **client** (the frontend in the browser or mobile app) needs to store the token manually after receiving it from the server, and use it in future requests for authentication.

No, token storage on the client side does not happen automatically after the user signs in. The client (like a web app or mobile app) must be specifically programmed to save the token in a chosen storage location after receiving it from the server.

Here's what typically happens:

1. **Server Response**:
   - After the client logs in and the server generates the token, the server includes the token in the response, typically in JSON format. For example:
     ```json
     {
         "Token": "abcd1234efgh5678ijkl9012mnop3456"
     }
     ```

2. **Client Receives the Token**:
   - The client application (such as the frontend code of a web app or mobile app) receives this response and extracts the token.

3. **Client Stores the Token**:
   - The client application must contain code to decide where and how to store the token. This is usually handled by the developer writing frontend code, as this step requires explicit programming.
   - For example, in a web app, the client might use JavaScript to save the token in local storage:
     ```javascript
     localStorage.setItem('authToken', data.Token);
     ```
   - Alternatively, the client might store the token in a cookie or session storage, depending on the application's requirements.

4. **Token Usage for Subsequent Requests**:
   - For future requests to protected routes, the client code retrieves the token from the storage and includes it in the `Authorization` header.
   - For instance, the client might use code like this when making an authenticated request:
     ```javascript
     const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
     fetch('/dashboard', {
         headers: { 'Authorization': token }
     });
     ```

In summary, token storage is not automatic; the client code must be explicitly written to store and use the token as needed. This design allows flexibility, so developers can choose the most appropriate storage solution based on the app’s security needs.
