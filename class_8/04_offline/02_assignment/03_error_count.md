### 🔹 What is `next` in Express?

* `next` is a function Express gives you inside every route and middleware.
* Calling `next()` means: “I’m done here, pass control to the next middleware.”
* Calling `next(err)` means: “Something went wrong, send this error to the **global error handler**.”

---

### 🔹 Why is this powerful?

1. **Middleware chaining**

   * Normally, middleware is used for things like authentication, logging, or validation.
   * Example:

     ```js
     app.use((req, res, next) => {
       console.log("Request received");
       next(); // go to next handler
     });
     ```
   * This lets you stack multiple functions for every request without repeating code.

2. **Error handling**

   * If you pass an error (`next(err)`), Express *skips all normal middlewares* and directly jumps into the special **error-handling middleware** (the one with 4 parameters: `(err, req, res, next)`).
   * That’s why it solves your “error problem” too.
   * You don’t need `try…catch` everywhere → just throw or use `next(err)`, and all errors go to the same place.

---

### 🔹 So what happened in your project

* Before:

  * You had to write `try…catch` in every single route to catch errors.
  * Very repetitive.

* Now:

  * Your routes stay clean: just throw an error or call `next(err)`.
  * Express takes care of sending it to your **one global error handler**.
  * That error handler updates `errorCount` and sends `404`.

### 🔑 Insight

You just learned that **middleware + next** in Express is like a **pipeline**:

* `next()` → keeps flowing normally.
* `next(err)` → diverts into the “error lane,” handled globally.

---

So yes ✅ `next` doesn’t just solve the *middleware problem* (avoid repeating code across routes) but also the *error-handling problem* (central place to catch all exceptions).
