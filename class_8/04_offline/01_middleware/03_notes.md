# First Code Snippet
```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

function middleware(req, res, next) {
    let age = req.query.age
    if (age >= 14) {
        next();
    } else {
        res.json({
            bad_request: "you age is less than minimum criteria"
        })
    }
}

app.use(middleware)

app.get('/ride1', function (req, res) { 
    res.json({
        hooray: "you ridel the ride 1"
    })
})

app.get('/ride2', function (req, res) { 
    res.json({
        hooray: "you ridel the ride 2"
    })
})

app.listen(3000, ()=>{
    console.log("Your server is runing on http://localhost:3000/")
})
```

# Second Code Snippet
```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

function middleware(req, res, next) {
    let age = req.query.age
    if (age >= 14) {
        next();
    } else {
        res.json({
            bad_request: "you age is less than minimum criteria"
        })
    }
}
 

app.get('/ride1', middleware, function (req, res) {
    res.json({
        hooray: "you ridel the ride 1"
    })
})

app.get('/ride2', middleware, function (req, res) {
    res.json({
        hooray: "you ridel the ride 2"
    })
})

app.listen(3000, ()=>{
    console.log("Your server is runing on http://localhost:3000/")
})
```

# What is the difference between both the code and what if happen if i use the (app.use(middleware)) at the very end?

The two snippets of code you've provided implement middleware in an Express application, but they do so in different ways, affecting how the middleware is applied to your routes.

### Key Differences

1. **Middleware Application:**
   - **First Snippet (`app.use(middleware)`)**: This middleware is applied globally to all routes defined in the application. Therefore, every incoming request to any route will go through this middleware, checking the `age` query parameter.
   - **Second Snippet (`app.get('/ride1', middleware, ...)`)**: Here, the middleware is applied only to the specific routes `/ride1` and `/ride2`. The middleware will only check the `age` parameter for these two routes, while other routes (if any are defined later) won't have the middleware applied.

2. **Behavior on Different Routes:**
   - **First Snippet**: If a user accesses any route (like `/ride1` or `/ride2`) without the required `age`, they will receive the JSON response indicating the age is below the minimum criteria.
   - **Second Snippet**: If a user accesses a route that does not use the middleware, the `age` check will not occur, and they will be able to access that route regardless of their age.

### What Happens if You Use `app.use(middleware)` at the End?

If you place `app.use(middleware)` at the very end of your route definitions (after all your routes), the middleware will not apply to any of the defined routes. Here's what happens:

- **Request Handling**: Incoming requests will be handled by the routes defined before the middleware. The middleware would essentially act as a catch-all for any requests that do not match the previous routes. This means if a request matches one of the defined routes, it won't pass through the middleware.
- **No Age Check**: Since the middleware will only run after all other routes have been defined and the middleware is at the end, it won’t apply to any specific routes unless you have some catch-all route defined (like a wildcard route) after it. In this case, the age restriction won’t be enforced at all for the existing routes.

This would mean that `/ride1` and `/ride2` would be accessible without age checks, while the middleware would only affect any routes defined after this point. 

To summarize, the placement of middleware significantly affects which routes it applies to and how the application behaves based on the incoming requests.
