Let's break down the provided Express.js code step-by-step, explaining its structure and functionality. Then, weâ€™ll discuss how to provide input to this code.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Importing Express**:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express'); 
   const app = express();
   ```
   - The `express` module is imported, and an instance of an Express application is created and stored in the variable `app`.

2. **Middleware Function**:
   ```javascript
   function middleware(req, res, next) {
       let age = req.query.age; // Retrieve the 'age' query parameter from the request
       if (age >= 14) {
           next(); // If age is 14 or older, call the next middleware/route handler
       } else {
           res.json({
               bad_request: "your age is less than minimum criteria" // Send a response if age is less than 14
           });
       }
   }
   ```
   - The `middleware` function checks the `age` query parameter from the request URL.
   - If the `age` is 14 or older, it calls `next()` to pass control to the next route handler.
   - If the `age` is less than 14, it sends a JSON response indicating the age is below the minimum required.

3. **Using the Middleware**:
   ```javascript
   app.use(middleware);
   ```
   - This line applies the `middleware` function globally to all incoming requests. This means that every request to the server will first pass through this middleware.

4. **Defining Routes**:
   ```javascript
   app.get('/ride1', function (req, res) {
       res.json({
           hooray: "you ride the ride 1" // Response for ride 1
       });
   });

   app.get('/ride2', function (req, res) {
       res.json({
           hooray: "you ride the ride 2" // Response for ride 2
       });
   });
   ```
   - Two routes are defined: `/ride1` and `/ride2`. Both routes return a JSON response when accessed, but only after passing the middleware check.

5. **Starting the Server**:
   ```javascript
   app.listen(3000, () => {
       console.log("Your server is running on http://localhost:3000/");
   });
   ```
   - This line starts the Express server, listening on port 3000. When the server is running, a message is logged to the console.

### How to Provide Input

To provide input to this code, you'll need to use query parameters in the URL when making a request to the server. The middleware checks the `age` parameter from the URL's query string.

#### Example Input

- **Using a Web Browser**:
   - Open a web browser and enter the following URL:
     - For valid age: 
       ```
       http://localhost:3000/ride1?age=15
       ```
       or 
       ```
       http://localhost:3000/ride2?age=16
       ```
       This will return:
       ```json
       {
           "hooray": "you ride the ride 1"
       }
       ```
       or
       ```json
       {
           "hooray": "you ride the ride 2"
       }
       ```

     - For invalid age:
       ```
       http://localhost:3000/ride1?age=10
       ```
       This will return:
       ```json
       {
           "bad_request": "your age is less than minimum criteria"
       }
       ```

- **Using a Tool like Postman or cURL**:
   - In Postman, you can set the URL to `http://localhost:3000/ride1` and add a query parameter `age` with a value of `15` or `10`.
   - In cURL, you can use:
     ```bash
     curl "http://localhost:3000/ride1?age=15"
     ```

### Summary

This Express.js application uses middleware to enforce an age restriction on the routes `/ride1` and `/ride2`. By providing the age as a query parameter in the URL, users can access the rides if they meet the age requirement. Otherwise, they receive an appropriate error message.
