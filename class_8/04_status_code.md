HTTP status codes are standardized responses given by web servers to indicate the outcome of a client's request. These codes are part of the HTTP protocol and provide insight into whether a request was successful, encountered an error, or requires further action. Here’s a breakdown of the most common HTTP status codes, organized by their categories:

### 1. **Informational Responses (1xx)**
These codes indicate that the server has received the request and is continuing the process.

- **100 Continue**: The initial part of the request has been received, and the client should continue.
- **101 Switching Protocols**: The server is switching protocols as requested by the client.

### 2. **Successful Responses (2xx)**
These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested data.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a new resource has been created (commonly used with POST requests).
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there’s no content to return.

### 3. **Redirection Messages (3xx)**
These codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request, typically involving redirection to another URL.

- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been moved to a new URL permanently. The client should use the new URL in future requests.
- **302 Found (or Temporary Redirect)**: The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URL, but the client should continue to use the original URL for future requests.
- **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not changed since the last request, so the client can use its cached version.

### 4. **Client Error Responses (4xx)**
These codes indicate that there was an error with the request made by the client.

- **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax).
- **401 Unauthorized**: The request requires user authentication. The client must provide credentials.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it. This can occur if the client does not have permission to access the resource.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
- **408 Request Timeout**: The server timed out waiting for the request from the client.

### 5. **Server Error Responses (5xx)**
These codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.

- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message indicating that an unexpected condition was encountered by the server.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overload or maintenance.
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.

### Summary
HTTP status codes are crucial for understanding the outcome of requests made to web servers. They help both clients (like web browsers) and developers troubleshoot issues and optimize user experiences. Knowing how to interpret these codes can significantly aid in debugging and improving web applications.
