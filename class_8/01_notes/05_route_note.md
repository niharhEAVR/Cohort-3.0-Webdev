In web development, a **route** refers to a specific path or URL that directs a request to a particular resource or functionality within a web application. Here's a visual explanation of routes and how they work:

### Visual Explanation of Routes

Imagine a simple website structure:

```
http://www.example.com/
├── home
├── about
└── contact
```

Each of the following is a route that maps to a specific content or function:

1. **Root Route (`/`)**: This is the homepage of the website. When users visit `http://www.example.com/`, they see the homepage content.

2. **About Route (`/about`)**: When users visit `http://www.example.com/about`, they are directed to the About page, which contains information about the website or organization.

3. **Contact Route (`/contact`)**: Visiting `http://www.example.com/contact` takes users to the Contact page, where they can find a contact form or information.


### Route Parameters

Routes can also have dynamic parameters. For instance, consider the following URL:

```
http://www.example.com/users/123
```


### Summary

- **Routes** map specific URLs to functionalities or resources.
- Each route can lead to different content based on the path in the URL.
- Dynamic routes can handle parameters, allowing for more flexible applications.
