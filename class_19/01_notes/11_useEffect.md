### Q. If we dont use the useEffect then setInderval will rerender the app component ever second and when the app got rerendered then the setInterval also get rerenders many times?

Yes, you're absolutely right! Here's the detailed explanation:

### Without `useEffect`:

If you don't use `useEffect` to manage the `setInterval`, what would happen is:

1. **The `setInterval` gets set every time the component re-renders**.
   - Initially, `setInterval` would run, updating the `count` every second.
   - However, each time the `App` component re-renders (which happens whenever the state changes), the `setInterval` would be **set up again**. This means **multiple intervals** would run in parallel, each one updating the `count` state.
   - This could lead to **unexpected behavior** where the count is incremented much faster than expected because multiple intervals are now updating the `count`.

2. **Re-renders lead to multiple intervals**:
   - Since the `setInterval` function is set inside the `App` component directly (without `useEffect`), every time the component re-renders, **a new interval is created**. This results in a growing number of intervals running simultaneously, causing the state (`count`) to update faster than expected.

### Why use `useEffect`?

To avoid this issue, **`useEffect`** is used for handling side effects like `setInterval`:

- The empty dependency array `[]` in `useEffect` ensures that the **interval is set only once**, when the component is first mounted.
- The **cleanup function** (the `return` statement inside `useEffect`) makes sure that when the component unmounts, the interval is cleared, preventing it from running in the background after the component is removed.
  
By using `useEffect`, React ensures that `setInterval` only runs **once** when the component mounts, and only cleans up the interval when the component is unmounted, avoiding the problem of setting multiple intervals on each re-render.

### Conclusion:

- **Without `useEffect`**: You create a new `setInterval` every time the component re-renders, which causes multiple intervals to run simultaneously.
- **With `useEffect`**: You set up `setInterval` once when the component mounts, and React ensures the interval is cleaned up when the component unmounts. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and multiple intervals.

### Q. So in react if we create a state inside a component and everytime we change the state then react rerenders that component

Yes, exactly! In React, if you create a state inside a component using `useState` (for functional components), React will re-render that component **every time the state changes**.

### Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Render**: When a component is first rendered, React initializes the state variable with the value passed to `useState`.

2. **State Change**: When you call the **state update function** (for example, `setCount`), React will update the state value. This triggers a **re-render** of the component with the new state value.

3. **Re-rendering**: When the component re-renders, the JSX inside the `return` statement is re-evaluated. This means the UI will reflect the updated state. However, React will **only re-render the component** if the state value has changed.

### Example:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  // Declare a state variable

  // Each time the button is clicked, the state (count) is updated
  // and React will re-render the Counter component.
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

- **Initial render**: `count` starts at `0`.
- **After clicking the button**: The `setCount` function updates the state. React re-renders the `Counter` component, and the new value of `count` is displayed.

### Key points:
- React **re-renders a component** whenever its state changes.
- This re-render is efficientâ€”React only re-renders the component that has changed and its children, not the entire page.
- **State changes trigger re-renders**, but React uses a **virtual DOM** to optimize updates, so it doesn't always trigger a full re-render of the real DOM.
