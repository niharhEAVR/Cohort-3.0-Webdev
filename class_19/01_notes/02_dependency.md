```json
"dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "react-native": "^0.76.1"
  },
```

The `"dependencies"` section in a `package.json` file lists the packages required for a project to run in production. In this case:

- **`react`** and **`react-dom`** are the core libraries for building React applications:
  - **`react`**: The primary library for creating user interfaces. It provides tools and APIs to build and manage UI components.
  - **`react-dom`**: Allows React to interact with the DOM, so you can render components to a web page. It's specifically for web applications, as it handles mounting React components to the browser's DOM.

The version numbers (`^18.3.1`) mean that any minor or patch version updates within the 18.x.x range will be compatible with this configuration.

### When to Use `react-native` as a Dependency

You would add **`react-native`** as a dependency if you're building a mobile application instead of a web app. `react-native` allows you to create mobile apps for iOS and Android using React, but unlike `react-dom`, it doesn't use the browser's DOM. Instead, it uses native mobile components, making apps feel truly "native" to the platform.

Here's how dependencies differ based on the project type:

- **For Web Applications**: Use `react` and `react-dom`.
- **For Mobile Applications (React Native)**: Use `react` and `react-native`. Note that you wonâ€™t need `react-dom` here because React Native interacts with mobile interfaces instead of the web DOM.

### The `react` remains constant for web or mobile app development
