Yes, exactly! Your analogy of a real-life scenario is very apt.

In a real-life web application, when you visit a specific page, it's similar to "mounting" the component associated with that page. The components in React that correspond to that page are rendered and mounted into the DOM. When you navigate to another page (or route), the components of the previous page are "unmounted" and the components of the new page are mounted.

In the context of **React cleanup**:
- When you **enter a page** (mounting the component), certain side effects, like timers, event listeners, or network requests, may start running.
- When you **leave the page** (unmounting the component), you need to **clean up** those side effects to ensure they don't continue running in the background, causing performance issues or memory leaks.

### Real-life Example

Imagine you're on a news website:
1. **Mounting**: 
   - When you visit the homepage, the components responsible for displaying the homepage content are mounted. 
   - If there's a feature on the homepage that updates a live score every second (using `setInterval`), that interval starts running when the homepage component is mounted.

2. **Unmounting**:
   - If you navigate away to a different page (for example, the profile page), the homepage component is unmounted.
   - The **cleanup** function is triggered, and the `setInterval` timer (or any other side effect) is **stopped**, as itâ€™s no longer needed. This prevents unnecessary operations from running when you're not on that page anymore.

3. **Mounting New Page**: 
   - Now, when you load the profile page, a new set of components are mounted. If this page requires a different side effect, such as an event listener or network request, it will start running. However, if the previous page had any lingering side effects, they would have been cleaned up before the new page was mounted.

### In Code Terms:

For example, on the homepage, you might have this:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    console.log("Updating score every second...");
  }, 1000);

  return () => clearInterval(interval);  // Cleanup when the component is unmounted
}, []);  // This effect only runs once when the component mounts
```

When you navigate away from this page, the component is unmounted, and the cleanup function (`clearInterval`) is called, stopping the interval.

### Why Cleanup is Necessary:

If you didn't clean up the interval (or any other side effect), the background process (like the interval) would continue running even after you left the page. This could lead to:
- **Memory Leaks**: The interval keeps running, consuming resources.
- **Performance Issues**: Background operations continue to use processing power and bandwidth unnecessarily.

In conclusion, **cleaning up side effects** when components are unmounted (like leaving a page) is a crucial practice in React to ensure your app stays efficient and free from memory leaks or redundant operations.
