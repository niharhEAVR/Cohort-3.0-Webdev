In this code, you’re using a custom `useDebounce` hook to debounce a function (`sendDataToBackend`) that sends a request to the backend when the user types in an input field. Debouncing is a technique used to delay a function’s execution until after a specified amount of time has passed since the last time it was invoked. This prevents the function from being called too frequently, which can be especially useful when dealing with events like typing in a text input or window resizing.

Here’s a breakdown of how the debounce functionality works in your code:

### 1. `useDebounce` Hook:
The `useDebounce` hook takes `originalFn` as an argument and returns a debounced version of this function.

- **State and Ref Setup**: Inside `useDebounce`, `currentClock` is a reference created by `useRef()`. It will hold the ID of the timer that’s set each time the `debouncedValue` function is called. Using `useRef` here ensures the timer ID persists across re-renders without triggering component re-renders.

- **Debounced Function** (`debouncedValue`):
  - `clearTimeout(currentClock.current);`: This clears any previously set timer, so if the `debouncedValue` function is called again within 200ms, it resets the timer.
  - `currentClock.current = setTimeout(originalFn, 200);`: This sets a new timer for 200 milliseconds, after which `originalFn` will be called.
  
  This way, `originalFn` (in this case, `sendDataToBackend`) will only run if there hasn’t been another invocation of `debouncedValue` within the last 200ms. Each new call to `debouncedValue` resets the timer, effectively delaying the execution until the user stops typing for 200ms.

### 2. Usage in `App` Component:
In `App`, the debounced version of `sendDataToBackend` is assigned to `deBouncedFunc`, which is passed to the `onChange` event handler of the `<input>` element. Here’s what happens as the user types:

- Every time the user types a character, `deBouncedFunc` is called.
- `deBouncedFunc` clears the existing timer and sets a new one for 200ms.
- If the user keeps typing quickly, `deBouncedFunc` keeps resetting the timer, so `sendDataToBackend` isn’t called.
- Only when the user pauses for at least 200ms will `sendDataToBackend` be executed.

### Summary
This debounce mechanism prevents `sendDataToBackend` from firing on every keystroke, making it efficient and reducing unnecessary requests to the backend. Only one request will be made after the user stops typing for 200ms, which you can observe in the Network tab by seeing fewer requests than the number of keystrokes.

Let's break down the debounce functionality and why it works the way it does.

### Concept of Debouncing

Debouncing is used to control how often a function is executed. It delays the function execution until after a certain amount of time has passed since the last time it was triggered. For example, if you're typing in a search bar, you don't want to send a request to the server after each character is typed. Instead, you want to wait until the user stops typing for a short period (e.g., 200ms), then send the request. This helps to avoid unnecessary API calls.

### Key Parts of the `useDebounce` Hook

1. **`useRef`**:
   - `const currentClock = useRef();`
   - `useRef` is used to store a mutable reference that persists across re-renders of the component. Here, `currentClock` will hold the timer ID returned by `setTimeout`. Using `useRef` is important because we don't want React to re-render the component every time the timer is set or cleared.

2. **`debouncedValue` Function**:
   This function is returned by the `useDebounce` hook and is the one actually used as the event handler (like in the `onChange` of the input).
   
   Inside `debouncedValue`, two things happen:
   
   a. **Clearing the Existing Timer**:
   ```js
   clearTimeout(currentClock.current);
   ```
   - Every time the `debouncedValue` function is called (which happens on each keystroke), it clears the previous timer. This ensures that if the function is called again before the delay (`200ms`), the previous timer is reset and doesn't execute. 
   
   b. **Setting a New Timer**:
   ```js
   currentClock.current = setTimeout(originalFn, 200);
   ```
   - This line sets a new timer using `setTimeout`. `originalFn` (in this case, the `sendDataToBackend` function) will be executed after 200ms. If `debouncedValue` is called again before those 200ms have passed, the previous timer will be cleared, and a new one will start, meaning the function won't be executed until 200ms have passed without another invocation.

### What Happens During Typing:
Let’s walk through an example where the user is typing in the input field:

- **First keystroke**: `debouncedValue` is called, and a 200ms timer starts.
- **Second keystroke**: `debouncedValue` is called again before 200ms have passed, so the previous timer is cleared, and a new 200ms timer starts.
- This continues as long as the user is typing fast enough.
- **After 200ms of inactivity** (i.e., the user stops typing for 200ms), `originalFn` (which is `sendDataToBackend`) is called.

### Why This Works:
This mechanism ensures that `sendDataToBackend` (or whatever function is passed to `useDebounce`) is not called too frequently. It only gets called after the user stops typing for 200ms, reducing unnecessary calls to the backend.

To summarize:

1. When `debouncedValue` is called (every time you type), it **cancels** the previous timer.
2. It then **sets a new timer**.
3. After the user stops typing for 200ms, the function (`originalFn`) is executed.

Does that help clarify how the debouncing mechanism is working?
