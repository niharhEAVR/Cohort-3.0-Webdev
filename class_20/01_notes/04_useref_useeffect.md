### oen benefif ot useRef that react understands that we used a useRef and it will stop re-rendering


---

`useRef` does not work like `useEffect`, but they can complement each other, especially when working with `setInterval` or similar side effects.

### Differences Between `useRef` and `useEffect`

- **`useRef`** is primarily used for **persisting values** between renders without triggering re-renders. It is not designed for running side effects or creating intervals.
- **`useEffect`** is used to run **side effects** (like `setInterval`, API calls, DOM manipulations, etc.) after a render cycle. It’s useful for handling things that happen outside the normal render flow of your component, such as setting up and cleaning up intervals.

### How `useRef` and `useEffect` Work Together

When you use `setInterval` in React, you typically use `useEffect` to set it up, and you might use `useRef` to persist values across renders without triggering re-renders.

#### Example: Using `useRef` with `setInterval`

Let's say you want to use `setInterval` to update a counter, but you don’t want the counter to cause a re-render on every update.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";

function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const countRef = useRef(count); // This will store the current count without causing re-renders

  // Set up an interval to update the count every second
  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      // Update the count via useState
      setCount((prev) => prev + 1);

      // Persist the current count in the ref
      countRef.current = countRef.current + 1;
    }, 1000);

    // Clean up the interval when the component is unmounted
    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means it runs only once, when the component mounts

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Timer: {count}</h1>
      <h2>Ref Count: {countRef.current}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Timer;
```

### Explanation:

1. **`useState`** is used to trigger a re-render when `count` is updated (this is the visible part of the state).
2. **`useRef`** is used to persist the count value across renders without triggering a re-render. `countRef.current` is updated on every interval tick, but since changing `useRef` doesn’t cause a re-render, it is perfect for keeping track of values that you don’t need to display immediately.
3. **`useEffect`** is used to create the `setInterval`, and it cleans up the interval when the component unmounts, preventing memory leaks.

### Why Not Use `useRef` Alone for `setInterval`?

You cannot use `useRef` alone to execute side effects like `setInterval`. `useRef` doesn't trigger side effects or re-renders when its value changes. For side effects (e.g., starting and stopping intervals), `useEffect` is the right tool. However, if you want to persist a value (like the count) across renders and avoid re-renders when the value changes, `useRef` is a great choice.

### When Should You Use `useRef` with `setInterval`?

You use `useRef` in combination with `useEffect` to store values that need to persist across renders but should not trigger re-renders. In the example above, if you need to reference the current value of `count` inside the `setInterval` function (which doesn’t have access to the updated state directly due to closures), `useRef` allows you to keep the latest value of `count` without triggering unnecessary re-renders.

In summary:
- **`useEffect`** handles side effects like setting up and cleaning up intervals.
- **`useRef`** stores values that persist across renders without causing a re-render when the value changes.

So, `useRef` doesn't replace `useEffect`; instead, they work together to manage persistent data and side effects effectively in React.
