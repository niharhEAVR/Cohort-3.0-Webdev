               ^
JsonWebTokenError: jwt malformed
```
after running `04_jwt_malformed.js` program if you are seeing some problem like this then we have to know some key points down below:

The error `JsonWebTokenError: jwt malformed` usually means that the `signature` (the JWT you’re trying to verify) is either incorrectly formatted, incomplete, or not actually a valid JWT. Here’s what might be causing this issue and some steps to troubleshoot and resolve it.

### Possible Causes and Solutions

1. **Incorrect Signature Input**
   - The JWT passed as `signature` should be a complete JWT, typically in the format: `header.payload.signature`.
   - Ensure that `Signature` (the input to `verifiedJWT`) is a valid JWT string with three parts separated by periods.

   ```javascript
   const Signature = "<your_jwt_token_here>"; // Ensure this is a valid JWT string
   ```

2. **Verify the JWT Formatting**
   - Check if the `Signature` string is properly formatted. A JWT should look something like this:
     ```plaintext
     eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImpvaG5kb2UifQ.sflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
     ```
   - Each section should be a Base64-encoded string. Make sure there are no extra spaces or invalid characters.

3. **Correct JWT Secret**
   - Ensure that the `JWT_Secret` used in `jwt.verify` is the same one that was used to **sign** the JWT originally. If the secrets don’t match, verification will fail, as the JWT signature won’t validate.

4. **Check if Token Is Expired or Tampered With**
   - Sometimes tokens get malformed if someone tries to modify or tamper with them.
   - Ensure you’re using the exact token issued by the server without any modifications.

5. **Code Adjustment**
   - You could add error handling to provide more detailed feedback if the verification fails.

   Here’s an updated version of your function with added error handling:
   ```javascript
   const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

   function verifiedJWT(signature) {
       try {
           const responseJWT = jwt.verify(signature, JWT_Secret);
           return true; // Verification succeeded
       } catch (error) {
           console.error("JWT Verification Error:", error.message);
           return false; // Verification failed
       }
   }

   const Signature = "<your_jwt_token_here>"; // Replace with actual JWT token
   const response = verifiedJWT(Signature);
   console.log(response);
   ```

   - This version will log the exact error message if verification fails, helping you understand the specific issue.

### Summary
This error typically indicates a formatting or secret key mismatch issue. Make sure `Signature` is a valid, well-formed JWT and that the `JWT_Secret` is correct. With these checks, you should be able to resolve the `jwt malformed` error.

# Why we need to use try-catch?

In your code, you're using `jwt.verify` directly to verify the JWT, but **`jwt.verify` can throw errors** in certain situations (e.g., if the token is invalid, expired, or the signature doesn't match). This is why **`try-catch` is important**. Without it, if an error is thrown, it will cause your program to crash or return unexpected results.

### Why Should You Use `try-catch` with `jwt.verify`?

1. **Error Handling**:
   - `jwt.verify` will throw errors if:
     - The token is malformed (invalid format).
     - The token is expired.
     - The signature doesn't match the secret key (invalid or tampered token).
   - If you don't handle these potential errors, they will cause the application to crash.

2. **Graceful Failure**:
   - Using `try-catch` allows you to gracefully handle these errors and decide how to respond (e.g., log the error, return a specific error message, or simply return `false` if verification fails).

3. **Avoid Crashes**:
   - Without `try-catch`, when an error occurs, it will not only fail the verification but also stop your code execution abruptly. The `catch` block allows you to control the flow when an error occurs, without crashing your application.

### Example Code with `try-catch`:

Here’s how you should modify your function to use `try-catch` for error handling:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const JWT_Secret = "secret";

function verifiedJWT(signature) {
    try {
        const responseJWT = jwt.verify(signature, JWT_Secret); // Attempt to verify the JWT
        return true; // If verification succeeds, return true
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("JWT verification failed:", error.message); // Log the error message
        return false; // Return false if verification fails
    }
}

const Signature = "uhofho0h3ofh0i3h0ifh0pihfih3"; // Example of an invalid token (or expired)
const response = verifiedJWT(Signature);
console.log(response); // Should print `false` with an error message if the token is invalid
```

### How It Works:
1. **Inside the `try` block**: The code attempts to verify the token using `jwt.verify`. If the token is valid, it will return `true`.
2. **If an error occurs** (e.g., expired token, malformed token, etc.), the control moves to the `catch` block.
3. **In the `catch` block**: The error is logged (you can log more detailed information if needed), and the function returns `false` to indicate the failure of token verification.

### Types of Errors that `jwt.verify` Can Throw:
- **JsonWebTokenError**: When the token is not correctly signed or is malformed.
- **TokenExpiredError**: When the token has expired.
- **NotBeforeError**: When the token is not yet valid (e.g., if `nbf` is set in the token).
  
By using `try-catch`, you can safely handle these cases and prevent your application from crashing unexpectedly.
