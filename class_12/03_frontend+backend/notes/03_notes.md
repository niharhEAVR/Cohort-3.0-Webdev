In JSON Web Tokens (JWT), the `"iat"` field stands for **"issued at"**. This field represents the timestamp when the token was created. Itâ€™s typically given in **Unix epoch time** (seconds since January 1, 1970), which can be converted to a readable date.

### Explanation of `iat`

- **Purpose**: The `iat` claim is used to record the exact time when the JWT was issued. It can help with verifying the token's age and preventing tokens from being reused indefinitely.
- **Format**: The `iat` value is a timestamp in seconds.
- **Example in your token**: 

  ```json
  {
    "username": "cool",
    "iat": 1731052646
  }
  ```

  In this example, `1731052646` represents the timestamp when the token was created.

### How to Interpret `iat`

To get a readable date from `iat`, you can convert this Unix timestamp to a standard date and time. For example, in JavaScript:

```javascript
const iat = 1731052646;
const date = new Date(iat * 1000); // Multiply by 1000 to convert to milliseconds

console.log(date.toISOString()); 
// you can do this or
console.log(date.toLocaleString()); 
// or
console.log(date.toUTCString()); 
// or
const formattedDate = `${date.getDate()}/${date.getMonth() + 1}/${date.getFullYear()} ${date.getHours()}:${date.getMinutes()}:${date.getSeconds()}`;
console.log(formattedDate);
```

This gives you a clear date and time in UTC, showing when the token was issued.
