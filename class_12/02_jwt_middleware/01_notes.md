**What is the purpose of `jwt_middleware`?**

The purpose of `jwt_middleware` is to avoid repeatedly checking if the user has a valid token for each request or route. Instead of manually verifying the token on every route, we can create a middleware that performs the token verification once. After that, we can apply this middleware to every protected route, so the token verification is done automatically for each request.
