This comparison is explaining how JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) work, especially the distinction between "decoding" and "verifying" them. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **JWT Decoding**:
   - JWTs are encoded in a base64 format, so anyone who has the token can decode it to see its contents. This includes the information in the token’s payload, such as the user's ID or permissions.
   - However, decoding a JWT does *not* prove that it’s legitimate or valid. It simply reveals the data it contains.

2. **JWT Verification**:
   - Only the server that issued the JWT (using the `JWT_SECRET`) can *verify* that the token is authentic. This verification process uses the secret to confirm that the token has not been tampered with.
   - Without the correct `JWT_SECRET`, no one else can create or verify the authenticity of the token, even though they can decode and read it.

3. **Analogy to a Cheque**:
   - Just like a cheque, anyone can see its contents (e.g., the amount and recipient), but only the bank can verify the cheque’s authenticity based on the issuer's signature. This prevents forgery.
   - Similarly, with JWTs, even if someone can read the token, they can’t make unauthorized changes or verify it as authentic without the `JWT_SECRET`.

So, while JWTs are *readable* by anyone, they’re only *verifiable* by the issuing server, making the `JWT_SECRET` crucial for security.
