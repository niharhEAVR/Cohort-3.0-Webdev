```javascript
await userModel.updateOne({
        username: username
    }, {
        "$push": {
            purchasedCourses: courseId
        }
    })
```

In this line of code, you're using Mongoose to update a user's document in the `userModel` collection. Let's break it down:

1. **`await userModel.updateOne({ ... }, { ... })`**:
   - `userModel` is the Mongoose model for the user collection in MongoDB.
   - `updateOne()` is a Mongoose method that updates a single document in the collection.
   - `await` ensures that the code waits for the update operation to complete before proceeding.

2. **First argument: `{ username: username }`**:
   - This is the filter or query condition. You're looking for a document in the `userModel` collection where the `username` field matches the `username` variable.
   - The `username` variable is likely a value you are passing into this update function, representing the user whose purchased courses you want to update.

3. **Second argument: `{ "$push": { purchasedCourses: courseId } }`**:
   - This is the update operation. You're using the `$push` operator to add a value to an array field in the document.
   - The `purchasedCourses` field is assumed to be an array in the user's document, and you're adding `courseId` (likely the ID of a course) to that array.
   - `$push` ensures that `courseId` is added to the `purchasedCourses` array for the specified user.

### In summary:
This code finds a user by their `username` and then adds a new course ID (`courseId`) to the `purchasedCourses` array in that user's document. If the user doesn't already have `courseId` in their `purchasedCourses`, it will be added.

### relationship with database:
```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    username: String,
    password: String,
    purchasedCourses: [{
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref : "courses" 
    }]
})
```
In this part of the code, you're defining the `purchasedCourses` field in the Mongoose schema for the `userModel`. Let me break down what this means:

1. **`purchasedCourses: [{ ... }]`**:
   - This defines `purchasedCourses` as an **array** of objects. Each object in the array represents a course that the user has purchased.
   - The `[]` brackets indicate it's an array, meaning a user can purchase multiple courses.

2. **`type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId`**:
   - `ObjectId` is a special type in MongoDB that is used to represent the unique identifier for documents in a collection. In this case, it means that each element in the `purchasedCourses` array will be an ObjectId.
   - Essentially, each course in the array will be represented by its MongoDB `_id`.

3. **`ref: "courses"`**:
   - This tells Mongoose that the `ObjectId` in the `purchasedCourses` array refers to a document in the `courses` collection.
   - The `ref` option is used for **population**. When you later fetch the user and want to get the details of the courses they have purchased, Mongoose will look up the corresponding course documents in the `courses` collection using the `ObjectId` stored in `purchasedCourses`.
   - For example, if you query the user and populate the `purchasedCourses` field, Mongoose will replace the ObjectIds in the array with the actual course document data from the `courses` collection.

### In summary:
- The `purchasedCourses` field in the `userModel` schema is an array of ObjectIds, where each ObjectId corresponds to a course in the `courses` collection.
- The `ref: "courses"` tells Mongoose to treat these ObjectIds as references to documents in the `courses` collection, allowing for easy population of course data when fetching user data.

```javascript
 const coursesData = await courseModel.find({
        _id: { $in: user.purchasedCourses }
    })
```

In this line of code, you're using Mongoose to query the `courseModel` for a set of courses based on the `_id` field. Let me break it down:

1. **`await courseModel.find({ ... })`**:
   - `courseModel` is presumably a Mongoose model for your course collection in MongoDB.
   - `find()` is a Mongoose method used to fetch documents from the collection.
   - `await` ensures that the code waits for the query to complete before moving forward.

2. **`{ _id: { $in: user.purchasedCourses } }`**:
   - You're searching for courses where the `_id` matches any value in the `user.purchasedCourses` array.
   - `user.purchasedCourses` is likely an array of course IDs that the user has purchased.
   - The `$in` operator in MongoDB is used to match any value in the array. So, this query will return all courses whose `_id` is in the `user.purchasedCourses` array.

Essentially, this code finds all the courses in the database whose `_id` exists in the array of course IDs that the user has purchased. If you don't understand the specific details of the query, the `02_notes.md` file in the `01_notes` folder might have further explanations, as indicated in your comment.
