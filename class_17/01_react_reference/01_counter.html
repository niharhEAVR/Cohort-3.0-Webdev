        <h3><b>Why we need React?</b></h3>
        People realised it’s harder to do DOM manipulation the conventional way.
        <br>
        There were libraries that came into the picture that made it slightly easy, but still for a very big app it’s
        very hard (JQuery).
        <br>
        Eventually, VueJS/React created a new syntax to do frontends
        Under the hood, the react compiler convert your code to HTML/CSS/JS
    </div>

    <br><br><br>
    <button>Counter 0</button>
    <script>
        document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", () => {
            const current = document.querySelector("button").innerHTML;
            const currentValue = current.split(" ")[1]
            const increasedValue = parseInt(currentValue) + 1
            document.querySelector("button").innerHTML = "Counter " + increasedValue
        })
    </script>
</body>
