You're looking at the **`package.json`** file ‚Äî this is the **brain of your React project**.
Everything about your project ‚Äî name, version, scripts, dependencies ‚Äî lives here.

Let me explain it **like a beginner** üëá

---

### Top Basics

```json
"name": "my_app",
"private": true,
"version": "0.0.0",
"type": "module"
```

| Key                | Meaning                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"name"`           | Your project name                                                                    |
| `"private": true`  | Prevents accidental publishing to npm (good!)                                        |
| `"version"`        | Version of your app ‚Äî irrelevant for now                                             |
| `"type": "module"` | Tells Node.js to use **modern ES module (import/export)** instead of old `require()` |

---

### üõ† `scripts` ‚Äî Your Commands

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```

This lets you run commands like:

| Command | You Type          | What It Does                              |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| dev     | `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server (hot reload)      |
| build   | `npm run build`   | Prepares optimized production files       |
| preview | `npm run preview` | Preview your production build             |
| lint    | `npm run lint`    | Checks your code for errors/bad practices |

---

### üì¶ `dependencies` ‚Äî Needed **in production**

```json
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^18.3.1",
  "react-dom": "^18.3.1"
}
```

These are **required to run your app** in the browser.

| Package   | Why Needed                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| react     | The core React library                                             |
| react-dom | Helps React render to the browser (like `document.getElementById`) |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è `devDependencies` ‚Äî Needed **only while developing**

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@vitejs/plugin-react": "...",
  "eslint": "...",
  "vite": "...",
  ...
}
```

These are tools for **developer convenience**, not needed in the final output.

| Package                | What It Does                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vite`                 | Super fast React development server                               |
| `@vitejs/plugin-react` | Makes Vite understand React's JSX                                 |
| `eslint`               | Checks your code for mistakes                                     |
| `eslint-* plugins`     | Extra rule sets to catch bad React code                           |
| `@types/react`         | Gives autocomplete & intellisense in VS Code (TypeScript typings) |

### In short

| Section           | Purpose                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `scripts`         | Shortcut commands for dev, build, etc     |
| `dependencies`    | Required to **run** the app               |
| `devDependencies` | Required to **develop** the app           |
| EVERYTHING HERE   | Auto-installed when you run `npm install` |

# 1) `scripts` ‚Äî what they are and how npm runs them

The `scripts` object in `package.json` stores *named commands* you can run with `npm run <name>` (or `yarn <name>` for Yarn). They‚Äôre just shortcuts that run commands in your shell.

Your example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```

## How to run

* `npm run dev` ‚Üí runs `vite`
* `npm run build` ‚Üí runs `vite build`
* `npm run lint` ‚Üí runs `eslint .`
* `npm run preview` ‚Üí runs `vite preview`

> Note: `npm start` is special ‚Äî if there is a `start` script you can run it with `npm start` (without `run`). `dev` and others require `npm run`.

## What npm actually does when running a script

* Adds `node_modules/.bin` to the `PATH`, so locally installed packages are runnable by name (e.g., `vite`, `eslint`).
* Runs the command in a shell (on Windows that‚Äôs `cmd.exe` by default).
* Exposes some environment variables (like `npm_package_name`) for advanced script use.

## Script lifecycle hooks (convenient automation)

You can define `pre` and `post` hooks automatically:

```json
"scripts": {
  "prebuild": "rimraf dist",
  "build": "vite build",
  "postbuild": "echo Build finished"
}
```

When you run `npm run build`, npm will run `prebuild` ‚Üí `build` ‚Üí `postbuild`.

## Useful script patterns

* Combine commands: `"lint:fix": "eslint . --fix"`
* Run multiple commands (cross-platform): use packages like `npm-run-all` or `cross-env` for env variables.
* Set env var inline (posix): `NODE_ENV=production vite build` (Windows differs; use `cross-env`).

## `npx` and `npm run`: what's different?

* `npx <pkg>` will run a binary either from local `node_modules/.bin` or download and run it temporarily.
* `npm run <script>` runs scripts from `package.json` (and therefore can chain multiple tasks).

---

# 2) What is *production* vs *development*?

**Development** = where *you* write and test code. Tools you run:

* hot-reload dev server (Vite)
* linters, formatters
* source maps (to debug compiled JS)
* unminified code (readable)
* fast builds, less optimization

**Production** = what *your users* load in the browser:

* optimized, minified, tree-shaken code
* CSS & JS bundles (smaller file sizes)
* no dev-only tooling running in the browser
* assets copied to `dist/` or `build/` and served by a static host or web server

## Typical developer flow

1. `npm run dev` ‚Äî run Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173` (fast HMR, unoptimized).
2. When ready for release: `npm run build` ‚Äî bundler compiles, treeshakes, minifies and creates `dist/` (production-ready).
3. `npm run preview` ‚Äî serve the `dist/` locally to verify (Vite‚Äôs preview runs a simple static server).

## `NODE_ENV`

* Historically `NODE_ENV` is used to tell tools whether you‚Äôre in `"development"` or `"production"`.
* Build tools often replace conditional code like `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production')` so production bundles can exclude debug code.
* Bundlers typically set this automatically when you run a production build (e.g., `vite build`).

---

# 3) `dependencies` vs `devDependencies` (and other dependency types)

### `dependencies`

* Declared under `"dependencies"`.
* Installed with `npm install <pkg>` (default).
* Required at **runtime** ‚Äî i.e., your production bundle or server needs them.
* Example: `react`, `react-dom`, UI libraries you import into your components.

If you deploy to production and run `npm install --production` or `--omit=dev`, packages in `dependencies` will be installed, devDependencies skipped.

### `devDependencies`

* Declared under `"devDependencies"`.
* Installed with `npm install <pkg> --save-dev` (or `npm i -D <pkg>`).
* Needed **only while developing or building**: bundlers, test frameworks, linters, types, build plugins.
* Example: `vite`, `eslint`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `@types/react` (TypeScript type hints).

**Important:** devDependencies are not included on production installs if you run `npm install --omit=dev` (or `NODE_ENV=production npm install --omit=dev`). But if you run a build step on the server that requires devDependencies, you must install them first (or use CI to build before deploy).

---

### Other dependency fields

* `peerDependencies`:

  * Means: ‚ÄúI expect the consumer to provide this dependency.‚Äù Common for libraries.
  * Example: A UI library may list `react` as a `peerDependency` so that your app supplies the single React instance.
  * If missing, npm prints a warning (npm v7+ auto-installs peer deps in some cases ‚Äî behavior changed across versions).

* `optionalDependencies`:

  * Package may or may not install successfully ‚Äî failure won‚Äôt break the full install.
  * Useful for native modules that might fail to build on some platforms.

* `bundledDependencies` / `bundleDependencies`:

  * Packages that should be bundled into the package when publishing.

---

# 4) How installs and locks work: `node_modules` & `package-lock.json`

* `node_modules/` ‚Äî the actual installed packages (folder heavy).
* `package.json` ‚Äî records *which* packages you want (and semver ranges).
* `package-lock.json` ‚Äî exact resolved versions and dependency tree. Ensures consistent installs across machines and CI.

  * When you push code, commit `package-lock.json` so others (and CI) get the same versions.
  * `npm ci` uses `package-lock.json` to produce reproducible installs (faster, clean install). Use in CI.

### Common install commands

* `npm install` ‚Äî installs packages from `package.json` (resolves versions using package-lock if present).
* `npm ci` ‚Äî intended for CI; purges `node_modules` and installs exactly what's in `package-lock.json`.
* `npm install --production` or `npm install --omit=dev` ‚Äî skip devDependencies (used in production servers).
* `npm install <pkg>` ‚Äî adds to `dependencies` (default).
* `npm install <pkg> --save-dev` or `-D` ‚Äî adds to `devDependencies`.

---

# 5) Exactly what happens when you run the scripts in your file

Given your `package.json`:

* `npm run dev` ‚Üí runs `vite`:

  * Vite starts a dev server (unbundled ES modules, fast hot module replacement).
  * It serves source files directly, transforms them on demand.

* `npm run build` ‚Üí runs `vite build`:

  * Vite bundles the app for production (Rollup under the hood).
  * Output: optimized files (e.g., `dist/index.html`, `dist/assets/*.js`).
  * Steps: transpile JSX/TS ‚Üí tree-shake unused exports ‚Üí minify ‚Üí emit hashed filenames for cache-busting.

* `npm run preview` ‚Üí runs `vite preview`:

  * Starts a static server to serve `dist/` so you can verify the build like it would run in production.

* `npm run lint` ‚Üí runs `eslint .`:

  * ESLint reads rules (from config) and reports code issues; with `--fix` it can fix some automatically.

---

# 6) Practical tips, best practices, and common pitfalls

## Keep `dependencies` minimal

* Anything only needed for building: put into `devDependencies`.
* Anything imported by your runtime code: must be in `dependencies`.

Example mistake: putting `axios` only in `devDependencies`. If your components `import axios`, in production it will be missing if you install with `--omit=dev`.

## Build on CI, deploy only built files

* Typical best practice: Build artifact on CI (GitHub Actions / CircleCI), push static files (`dist/`) to your hosting, or a Docker image that contains the built app.
* That way the production server doesn‚Äôt need devDependencies.

## Slim your final bundle

* Use dynamic imports for rarely-used code (`import()`).
* Avoid importing entire big libraries (`import _ from 'lodash'` vs `import { debounce } from 'lodash'` or `lodash-es`).
* Tree-shaking depends on ES module exports.

## Use `npm ci` for reproducible installs on CI

* Faster and deterministic. Use `npm ci` in CI pipelines, not `npm install`.

## Keep `package-lock.json` committed

* This ensures everyone installs the same versions.

## When you need a package at runtime on the server

* For server-side Node apps, dependencies are installed to runtime environment ‚Äî don't omit needed devDependencies.

## Moving a package between deps/devDeps

* `npm i <pkg>` ‚Üí adds to `dependencies`.
* `npm i -D <pkg>` ‚Üí adds to `devDependencies`.
* To move, uninstall then re-install with the correct flag:

  * `npm uninstall pkg`
  * `npm i -D pkg` (or `npm i pkg`)

## Security & audits

* `npm audit` will report known vulnerabilities. Keep dependencies updated; use tools like `dependabot` or `npm-check-updates` (ncu).

# 7) Quick examples & commands you‚Äôll use often

Install package for runtime:

```bash
npm install axios      # adds to dependencies
```

Install package for development:

```bash
npm install -D vite eslint @vitejs/plugin-react
```

Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
# -> opens dev server with HMR
```

Create production build:

```bash
npm run build
# -> outputs dist/
```

Preview production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
# -> serve files from dist/
```

Install exactly as lockfile says (CI):

```bash
npm ci
```

Install only prod dependencies on server:

```bash
npm install --omit=dev
# or
NODE_ENV=production npm install --omit=dev
```

# 8) Short summary / cheat-sheet

* `scripts` are shortcuts in `package.json` to run commands (development, build, lint, test).
* `dev` = development server (fast, unminified); `build` = production output (optimized).
* `dependencies` = required at **runtime** (browser/server). Must be installed on production.
* `devDependencies` = required only **during development/build**. Skip them on production installs to save space.
* `package-lock.json` + `npm ci` = deterministic installs (use in CI).
* Build on CI and deploy artifacts to production to avoid installing devDependencies there.
