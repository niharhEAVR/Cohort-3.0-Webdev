### when i install any external library on my turbo backend server then i dont see the node_modules on my that backend server folder but i can use that library how does its happens and where did the module installed?


In a **Turborepo** project, when you install a library in one of your backend (or frontend) projects, Turborepo leverages **workspace** behavior provided by **npm** or **Yarn** to manage dependencies across all the packages (apps and packages) in the monorepo. This allows your individual apps (like the backend server) to use external libraries without having to install them directly inside their own `node_modules` folder. The dependencies are typically installed at the **root** of the monorepo, and the apps can access them using **symlinks**.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how this works:

---

### **How Dependencies Are Installed in a Turborepo Project:**

1. **Monorepo Workspace**
   - The root directory of your Turborepo project contains a `package.json` that may include a **workspaces** configuration for the apps and packages in your monorepo.

   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "private": true,
     "workspaces": [
       "apps/*",
       "packages/*"
     ]
   }
   ```
   This setup tells npm (or Yarn) that all directories inside `apps/` and `packages/` are part of the workspace, and any dependencies installed are shared across the workspace.

2. **Root-Level `node_modules` Folder:**
   - When you run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) from the root of your monorepo, the dependencies are installed at the **root level** under the `node_modules` folder. This folder contains the **dependencies for all the apps** inside the workspace.
   - Instead of each app having its own `node_modules`, they all use the **centralized `node_modules`** in the root directory.

3. **Accessing Dependencies in a Specific App (e.g., Backend Server):**
   - Even though the external libraries don't appear in the `node_modules` folder inside your specific backend server app's folder, the app can still access them through **symlinks** or **hoisting**.
   - **Hoisting** means that dependencies are placed at the root-level `node_modules`, and each package's `node_modules` references them from there.

4. **Symlinks**:
   - Under the hood, when you install a dependency in the **root** of the monorepo, npm or Yarn will create symbolic links (symlinks) in your individual project’s `node_modules` folders that point to the actual modules in the root `node_modules` directory.
   - This makes it look like the backend server has its own `node_modules` (even if it doesn't physically contain them), but the modules are actually **shared** from the central root directory.

---

### **Why It Happens:**
- **Efficiency**: By having dependencies in a single `node_modules` folder at the root of the project, Turborepo avoids **duplicate installations** of the same library in each app and allows **sharing dependencies** efficiently.
- **Consistency**: This ensures that all packages in the monorepo are using the **same version** of the external libraries, avoiding version mismatches between the apps.

---

### **How It Appears in Your Backend Server Folder:**
- When you install a new dependency using a package manager (like `npm install <library>` or `yarn add <library>`) in the root of the monorepo, the backend server can access the installed dependency without having it inside its own `node_modules`.
  
   For example, if you run:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```
   This installs the `express` module into the root-level `node_modules`, but **your backend can still import and use it** as if it was installed in its own `node_modules` folder because it can find it in the root-level `node_modules`.

### **What Happens in the Folder Structure:**

- **Root-level `node_modules`** contains **all shared dependencies** for all apps and packages.
- Individual `apps/backend` directories won’t have their own `node_modules`, but can still import modules from the root `node_modules` through symlinks.

So, you won't see a `node_modules` folder inside your backend server folder, but the dependencies installed in the root directory are still usable by the backend because of **hoisting and symlinks**.

---

### **Summary**:
- When you install libraries in a Turborepo-based project, they are installed in the **root `node_modules` folder**.
- Your backend server (and any other app in the monorepo) will still be able to use those libraries through **hoisting** or **symlinks**.
- The `node_modules` in your specific backend server folder isn't created because Turborepo shares dependencies across all apps in the workspace.
