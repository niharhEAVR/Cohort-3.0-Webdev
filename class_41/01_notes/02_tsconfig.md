in a turborepo project the is two files apps and packages and we created 2 backend server on the apps folder but the two backend server takes same tsconfi file, so i create a backend.json file in the packages>typescript-config>backend.json, and pasted these {
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es2016",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "strict": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true
    }
}



and on the backend servers tsconfig.json we pasted these:

{
  "extends": "@repo/typescript-config/backend.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist",
  }
}



so explain it to me why did is uses this and why we need them?

### **Folder Structure**
Here’s a typical folder structure for your project based on the description:

```
turborepo-project/
├── apps/
│   ├── backend1/
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   ├── tsconfig.json
│   │   └── package.json
│   ├── backend2/
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   ├── tsconfig.json
│   │   └── package.json
├── packages/
│   ├── typescript-config/
│   │   ├── backend.json
│   │   └── package.json
├── package.json
├── turbo.json
└── tsconfig.base.json
```

### **Detailed Explanation**

#### **1. `backend1` and `backend2` in `apps/`**
- These are two independent backend servers that live inside the `apps/` directory.
- Each server contains:
  - `src/`: The directory where the TypeScript source code is located (e.g., `index.ts`).
  - `tsconfig.json`: Server-specific TypeScript configuration file that references the shared configuration.
  - `package.json`: Manages dependencies and metadata for each backend.

---

#### **2. `typescript-config/backend.json`**
- This file is inside `packages/typescript-config/`.
- It holds the **shared TypeScript configuration** used by both backend servers.

**Content of `backend.json`:**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2016",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

- This configuration contains:
  - `target: "es2016"`: The JavaScript version for the output.
  - `module: "commonjs"`: Module format suitable for Node.js.
  - `esModuleInterop: true`: Enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules.
  - `strict: true`: Enforces strict TypeScript rules for robust code.
  - `skipLibCheck: true`: Skips checking `.d.ts` files for faster compilation.

---

#### **3. `tsconfig.json` in Backend Servers (`backend1`, `backend2`)**
- These files **extend the shared configuration** to add project-specific options.

**Content of a backend server's `tsconfig.json`:**
```json
{
  "extends": "@repo/typescript-config/backend.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  }
}
```

- Extends the shared `backend.json`.
- Adds:
  - `rootDir: "./src"`: Defines where source files are located.
  - `outDir: "./dist"`: Defines where the compiled files are placed.

This keeps the server’s configuration lightweight and focuses only on project-specific needs.

---


- The pipeline defines tasks (`build`, `lint`, etc.) and their outputs (e.g., the `dist/` folder).

---

### **How It All Comes Together**

1. **Centralized Configuration (`backend.json`):**
   - Common TypeScript settings are stored in one file (`backend.json`), allowing easier maintenance and updates.
   
2. **Inheritance in Backend Servers:**
   - Each backend server (`backend1` and `backend2`) extends the shared configuration and adds their specific paths (`rootDir`, `outDir`).

3. **Modular Turborepo Workflow:**
   - The `apps/` folder holds application-specific code.
   - The `packages/` folder holds reusable packages, like `typescript-config`, shared by the applications.

The reason we didn’t include `"rootDir": "./src"` and `"outDir": "./dist"` in the `backend.json` file (in `packages/typescript-config`) is because these options are **project-specific** rather than **shared** settings. Here's why:

---

### **1. Purpose of `rootDir` and `outDir`**
- `rootDir`: Specifies the directory containing the source files. This is specific to each backend because:
  - The structure of the project may differ across applications.
  - One server might place its source code in `./src`, while another could use a different structure.
- `outDir`: Specifies where the compiled files are output. This is also specific because:
  - Different applications might need their output in distinct locations (e.g., `backend1/dist` vs. `backend2/dist`).

Including them in the shared `backend.json` would assume a fixed structure for every backend application, which might not always be the case.

---

### **2. Flexibility**
By placing `rootDir` and `outDir` in the `tsconfig.json` of individual backends:
- Each backend has the flexibility to decide:
  - Where its source files reside (`rootDir`).
  - Where its compiled files should go (`outDir`).
- It prevents accidental conflicts or limitations if backends need different setups.

---

### **3. Reusability Principle**
- Shared settings like `target`, `module`, and `strict` are **general-purpose TypeScript configurations** applicable to all backend projects.
- Settings that are **specific to how a project organizes its files or outputs its build artifacts** should remain in the local `tsconfig.json` files.

---

### **4. Example Scenario**
Imagine a case where:
- `backend1` uses:
  ```json
  {
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  }
  ```
- `backend2` decides to use:
  ```json
  {
    "rootDir": "./source",
    "outDir": "./build"
  }
  ```

By keeping these settings in individual `tsconfig.json` files, you avoid enforcing a shared directory structure on all backends, enabling them to have unique structures as needed.

---

### **Summary**
- **Why not in `backend.json`?**  
  Because `rootDir` and `outDir` are **backend-specific details**.
- **Why in individual `tsconfig.json`?**  
  To allow each backend to configure its unique file structure independently, avoiding unnecessary constraints.
