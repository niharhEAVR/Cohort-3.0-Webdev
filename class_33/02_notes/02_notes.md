```javascript
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

This SQL statement creates a table named `users` in a PostgreSQL database. Let's break it down step by step to understand what each part means:

---

### 1. **Table Name: `users`**
   - This is the name of the table being created. It will hold user-related data.

---

### 2. **Column Definitions**

#### a. **`id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`**
   - `id`: The name of the column.
   - `SERIAL`: Automatically generates a unique integer for each row inserted. Itâ€™s an auto-incrementing column.
   - `PRIMARY KEY`: Ensures that the `id` column is unique and cannot be null. It also serves as the main identifier for each row in the table.

#### b. **`username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL`**
   - `username`: The name of the column.
   - `VARCHAR(50)`: Limits the column to store up to 50 characters.
   - `UNIQUE`: Ensures that no two rows can have the same `username`.
   - `NOT NULL`: Prevents the column from being empty; a value must be provided for each row.

#### c. **`email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL`**
   - `email`: The name of the column.
   - `VARCHAR(255)`: Limits the column to store up to 255 characters.
   - `UNIQUE`: Ensures that no two rows can have the same `email`.
   - `NOT NULL`: Prevents the column from being empty; a value must be provided for each row.

#### d. **`password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL`**
   - `password`: The name of the column.
   - `VARCHAR(255)`: Limits the column to store up to 255 characters.
   - `NOT NULL`: Prevents the column from being empty; a value must be provided.

#### e. **`created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`**
   - `created_at`: The name of the column.
   - `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`: Stores date and time information, including the time zone.
   - `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`: Automatically sets the value of `created_at` to the current date and time when a new row is inserted.

---

### 3. **Purpose of the Table**
   - This table is designed to store user data, such as their:
     - Unique ID (`id`)
     - Username (`username`)
     - Email address (`email`)
     - Password (`password`)
     - Timestamp when the user was created (`created_at`).

---

### Example of Inserting Data into This Table
```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password)
VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com', 'securepassword123');
```

### Example of the Result
| id | username   | email              | password          | created_at                  |
|----|------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1  | john_doe   | john@example.com   | securepassword123 | 2024-11-30 15:00:00+00:00  |

---

### Summary
This table is a typical structure for storing user accounts in applications, ensuring proper constraints (like unique email and username) and logging the creation time of each user.
