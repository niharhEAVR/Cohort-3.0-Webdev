This line of code:

```javascript
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 3);
```

is hashing a password using the `bcrypt` library in JavaScript. Let’s break it down:

1. **`bcrypt.hash(password, 3)`**:
   - The `bcrypt.hash` function takes two arguments:
     - **`password`**: This is the plain-text password that the user provided, which you want to hash securely before storing it.
     - **`3`**: This is the **salt rounds** parameter, which determines how many rounds of hashing bcrypt will apply to the password. Here, it’s set to `3`.

2. **Salt Rounds Explained**:
   - Salt rounds (or "work factor") specify the number of hashing rounds. Higher values increase security by making the hash computation more complex and slower.
   - A higher salt rounds number means more computation is required, making it harder for attackers to use brute-force methods. Common values are between `10` and `12` in practice, with `3` being relatively low and mainly useful in testing.

3. **`await` Keyword**:
   - The `await` keyword is used because `bcrypt.hash` is an asynchronous function, meaning it returns a promise that will eventually resolve to the hashed password.
   - By using `await`, the function pauses at this line until the hash operation completes, then assigns the hashed result to `hashedPassword`.

4. **`hashedPassword`**:
   - The result stored in `hashedPassword` is the hashed version of the original password. You can store this hashed password in your database, rather than the plain-text password, to ensure security.

**Summary**: This line asynchronously generates a secure hash of the user’s password with a low salt round factor of `3`. In practice, you'd often use a higher salt round for production (e.g., `10`), as it increases security by slowing down brute-force attacks.

### Example Password format
    
```json
    password: "$2b$05$wua5zj9pnkK8jkaRBvlPn.yro1B2HRiAFdY17iAo7yXQvTh3RCeka"
```

exlanation of the hashed password:
    
- **`$2b$`**: Version of bcrypt.
- **`05$`**: Cost factor (saltRounds).
- **`wua5zj9pnkK8jkaRBvlPn`**: Salt value (base64 encoded).
- **`yro1B2HRiAFdY17iAo7yXQvTh3RCeka`**: Hashed password (base64 encoded).
