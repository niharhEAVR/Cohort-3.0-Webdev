The `.env.example` file is commonly used to provide a template of the environment variables needed for a project. It helps team members or other developers understand which variables are required, their expected names, and possible example values, without exposing sensitive information.

### Key Purposes of `.env.example`:
1. **Guidance**: Lists all environment variables that need to be set up for the application to run. It acts as a guide so that anyone working on the project knows what variables are needed.
2. **Security**: Unlike the `.env` file (which contains actual sensitive values like API keys, database URIs, and other credentials), the `.env.example` file doesnâ€™t contain real data, just placeholder values or examples. This file is safe to commit to version control (e.g., GitHub).
3. **Setup**: When a new developer clones the repository, they can copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the actual values. This helps to ensure consistency in the environment variable names across different setups.

### Example of a `.env.example` file:
```plaintext
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
```

The developer would then create a `.env` file (not shared publicly) that looks like this:

```plaintext
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
JWT_SECRET=somesecretkey
```

Using `.env.example` promotes better collaboration and security practices.
