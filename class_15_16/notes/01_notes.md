```javascript
app.use("/api/v1/user", userRouter);
app.use("/api/v1/admin", adminRouter);
app.use("/api/v1/course", courseRouter);

```

### **Versioning (`/v1`)**

The `/v1` part in `/api/v1/user`, `/api/v1/admin`, etc., is a version number for the API. API versioning is a common practice to ensure that changes or updates in the API do not break existing applications. Here’s why it’s beneficial:

   - **Backward Compatibility**: When you release updates, clients using older versions of the API aren’t forced to adapt to breaking changes immediately.
   - **Smooth Transition to Newer Versions**: New features or refactored code can be introduced in a new version (e.g., `/v2`), allowing clients to adopt the new features gradually.
   - **Clear API Evolution**: It’s easy to identify which version of the API a client is using, which makes maintaining and debugging easier.

#### For example:
   - In the future, if you introduce new functionalities or changes to the `user` routes that are incompatible with `v1`, you could create a `v2` version by adding a new set of routes, e.g., `app.use("/api/v2/user", userRouterV2);`.

Then, clients who want to use the new features can request `/api/v2/user` instead of `/api/v1/user`, while clients who prefer the older version can continue with `/v1`.

### **Benefits of This Structure**

- **Scalability**: As the app grows, you can keep different modules organized and separated by prefixing paths.
- **Maintainability**: It’s easier to locate and modify routes without affecting unrelated parts of the application.
- **Version Control**: Changes to one version of the API won’t disrupt older versions, reducing the impact of changes on existing clients.
- **Logical Organization**: It helps in logically organizing resources (users, admin, courses) and enables better management of routes.

### Example Structure with Versioning and Route Prefixes
Here’s a simple example that explains how to handle versioning and route prefixes.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Import routers
const userRouterV1 = require('./routes/v1/user');
const adminRouterV1 = require('./routes/v1/admin');
const courseRouterV1 = require('./routes/v1/course');

// Version 1 API routes
app.use("/api/v1/user", userRouterV1);
app.use("/api/v1/admin", adminRouterV1);
app.use("/api/v1/course", courseRouterV1);

// If a new version (v2) is created, add the routes like this:
const userRouterV2 = require('./routes/v2/user');
app.use("/api/v2/user", userRouterV2); // New version of user routes

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

This approach makes it very clear which version of the API and which resource you’re interacting with, helping to build a well-structured and maintainable API.
