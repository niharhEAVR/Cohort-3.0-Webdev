#### so all of the big pages on the internet uses next or normal html for their landing pages because nextjs and normal html have high seo oppurtunities, but their inside routes(like dashboard) are creates in reactjs?

You are mostly correct in observing that different types of technologies are typically chosen for different types of pages based on their needs. Here's a breakdown:

---

### 1. **Landing Pages (High SEO Priority):**
Landing pages (or public-facing pages like home pages, product pages, or blogs) often require:
- **Fast load times**: Users quickly see the content because itâ€™s pre-rendered.
- **Good SEO**: The page content should be crawlable by search engines like Google.
- **Static or Server-Side Rendering**: These pages don't change dynamically based on user input (in most cases).

For these reasons, technologies like:
- **Next.js (using Server-Side Rendering or Static Site Generation)** or
- **Pure HTML/CSS** (possibly enhanced with some JavaScript)  
are preferred for landing pages.

Why?
- HTML is instantly readable by browsers and search engines.
- Next.js makes it easy to generate highly performant pages with SEO benefits through static or server-side rendering.

### 2. **Dashboard or Internal Pages (User-Specific and Dynamic):**
For internal or user-specific routes like dashboards:
- **SEO is less critical**: These pages are often behind authentication (e.g., you must log in) and not indexed by search engines.
- **Dynamic content**: Dashboards depend on user-specific data, which changes based on the logged-in user.
- **Interactivity**: Dashboards often include charts, interactive tables, forms, or real-time updates.

These are typically built using:
- **React.js** (client-side rendering) or
- **React with Next.js (Hybrid - Client Components for interactivity)**. 

Why React (or similar SPA technologies)?
- The focus is on **user experience** rather than SEO.
- React provides efficient client-side state management and dynamic UI updates.
- React allows rich interactivity, making it ideal for personalized and feature-heavy interfaces.

### **Common Architecture for Modern Applications:**
Here's how modern apps handle this split:

| **Page Type**       | **Tech Choice**             | **Reason**                                                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Public pages         | Next.js (SSG/SSR) or HTML  | High SEO, fast load times, great for static or less dynamic content.   |
| Blog pages           | Next.js (SSG)              | Easy to pre-render, perfect for content-heavy pages.                   |
| Dashboard            | Next.js (CSR/Hybrid)       | Dynamic content, rich interactivity, user-specific experience.         |
| Admin/Authenticated  | React.js (Client Rendered) | Secure routes not indexed by search engines, fully dynamic.            |

### **In Practice:**
Yes, most **big websites** follow this kind of architecture:
- Use **Next.js or static HTML for landing pages** and other marketing pages because of **SEO opportunities** and performance.
- Use **React (client-heavy)** or **hybrid Next.js components for internal pages** like dashboards, admin panels, or other dynamic interfaces because those require rich interactivity and personalization.

So, your observation matches real-world trends! ðŸŽ¯
