Yes, that's correct for **Next.js** when using the **App Router** in `app` directory!

Here's a simplified explanation:

---

### **How Next.js Handles Async Pages**

1. **If an async function (e.g., `fetch` or `axios.get`) is used in a route's page**:
   - The page can't render immediately because it needs to wait for the data.
   - Next.js then looks for a `loading.tsx` file in the same route directory to show to the user **while waiting for the async data**.

2. **When the data is ready**:
   - Next.js stops showing the `loading.tsx` and switches to render your actual page (e.g., `page.tsx`) with the fetched data.

---

### **Step-by-Step Flow**
1. You visit `/user-backend`.
2. Your `page.tsx`:
   ```tsx
   export default async function Home() {
       const response = await axios.get("https://api.github.com/users/Nihar-Debnath");
       return <div>{response.data.name}</div>;
   }
   ```
   - Needs to make an API call to fetch data.
   - The `await` keyword causes a delay since it's waiting for the API response.

3. Next.js checks if there is a `loading.tsx` in `/user-backend`.
   - If it exists, **`loading.tsx` will render immediately** to show a loading state.
   - Example `loading.tsx`:
     ```tsx
     export default function Loader() {
         return <div>Loading...</div>;
     }
     ```

4. When the API call in `Home` completes:
   - Next.js removes the `loading.tsx` content and shows the **actual page** (`page.tsx`) with the fetched data.

---

### **Why This Happens**
Next.js does this to improve user experience:
- Users won't see a blank screen while waiting for data.
- Instead, they see a loading indicator or some placeholder content (e.g., `Loading...`).

---

### **If You Don't Want This Behavior**
- Remove the `loading.tsx` file from your route folder.
- This way, the browser will directly wait for the content of `page.tsx`, but users might experience a blank screen while the data fetch completes.

The reason you're seeing the "Loading..." first when visiting the `/user-backend` route in your Next.js app is due to how the `Loader` component interacts with **static rendering** and **loading states**. Here's what's likely happening:

---

### 1. **Static Rendering of `page.tsx`**
   - By default, in a Next.js app (not using the `app` directory), if you're exporting an `async` function in your page, it behaves as an **SSR (server-side rendered)** or **static-rendered (SSG)** component.
   - However, if **a loading state component (e.g., `Loader`) is used**, it likely comes from the `loading.tsx` in the `app` folder.

---

### 2. **Presence of `loading.tsx` in Next.js App Directory**
   If your project structure looks like this:
   ```bash
   /user-backend
   ├── loading.tsx
   └── page.tsx
   ```
   - When navigating to `/user-backend`, Next.js first renders `loading.tsx` if it's defined while `page.tsx` fetches the data (in your `Home` function). Once the data is ready, the `page.tsx` component replaces the `loading.tsx` content.
   - This is the expected behavior in the **App Router** introduced in Next.js 13+.

---

### 3. **Why This Happens:**
   - The `loading.tsx` is rendered during the **fetching phase** of your `Home` component. Since the data-fetching in `Home` involves a delay (due to your `axios` request and the deliberate `setTimeout` of 1 second), the `loading.tsx` stays visible until the server sends back the final HTML with the fetched data.

---

### 4. **Solution to Avoid Loading Screen First**
If you want to avoid seeing the `Loading...` message when visiting `/user-backend`, you can directly remove the `loading.tsx` or eliminate the async delay in your API call. Here's what you can do:

---

#### **Option 1: Remove `loading.tsx`**
Simply delete the `loading.tsx` file from the `/user-backend` folder:
```bash
/user-backend
└── page.tsx
```
Now, `/user-backend` will directly render `page.tsx` without a loading phase.

---


### Summary
The loading state you're seeing occurs because `loading.tsx` is a part of the default App Router behavior in Next.js 13+. Removing `loading.tsx` or pre-fetching data server-side with `getServerSideProps` will directly render your page with no intermediate state.
